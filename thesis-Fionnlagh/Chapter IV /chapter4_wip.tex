\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------
In this Chapter, the aim is to investigate the CSW behaviour of the straight jets and compare them against observations of H$\alpha$ spicules. Observations indicate that spicules generally emanate near the (inter)granulation lanes and remain subject to magnetohydrodynamic stresses (MHD) at their footpoint. The associated motions, irrespective of whether turbulent or coherent, become channelized through the spicule structure and are well reflected in their observed dynamic behaviour. Broadly, spicule kinematics can be categorized into three major domains: radially transverse, field-aligned, and torsional. These have been extensively examined and interpreted in terms of discrete MHD wave modes \citep[see review:][]{Zaqarashvili2009}. \np  
%
Since the discovery of standing kink oscillations, that cause transverse displacement in solar structures \citep{Aschwanden1999ApJ520880A, Nakariakov1999Sci285862N, Aschwanden2002SoPh20699A}, MHD waves in solar structures have gained much attention \citep[][\textit{e.g.}]{} {\color{green} !!get refs!!}. This due to their potential to provide estimates that we can't directly measure in solar structures (e.g. magnetic field strength) and they are thought to carry sufficient energy to heat the corona {\color{green} !!get refs!!}. The first report of Kink waves in spicules was by \cite{Kukhianidze2006}, and numerous studies have since followed with the goal of identification and study of transverse (kink and torsional \Alfven) wave modes \citep{DePontieu2007, Ebadi2014, Sharma2017} {\color{green} !!ref more!!}. However, reports of CSW variations remained elusive, due to current resolution limits for observations of jet-like chromospheric features. The presence of CSW variations in thin MFT structures, as a possible consequence of $m$ = 0 MHD sausage and/or $m$ = 2 fluting modes, were postulated in earlier theoretical studies \citep{Ziegler1997a, Ziegler1997, Ruderman2010}. Observations that report on CSW variations in spicular structures are limited to on-disk fibrils, where concurrent transverse and CSW were reported as coupled kink and sausage wave modes by \citet{Jess2012, Morton2012}. Similar observations for CSW and intensity oscillations in on-disk slender chromospheric fibrils were reported by \citet{Gafeira2017} and interpreted as MHD sausage wave modes. Moreover, an ensemble of coupled transverse, CSW and axisymmetric torsional motions were reported in off-limb spicules by \citet{Sharma2018}, which were interpreted as nonlinear kink wave mode. \np
%
An important aspect of spicules is they are essentially jet-like features where mass flows along their magnetic field with velocities of the range of $25-100\kms$  \citep{Beckers1972ARAA1073B, Sterling2000SoPh19679S, Pereira2012}. These velocities may even have a dominant effect on the waves that are present in spicular jets. Plasma flows will interact with the oscillatory modes of spicules, \textit{e.g.} periodic motions along or anti-parallel to the bulk motion will be affected differently. Wave motions in steady waveguides have been investigated in the past in a few theoretical studies \citep{Narayanan1991,nakariakov1995, terrahomem2003, soler2008} for different slab and cylindrical geometries. It was concluded that mass flows can generate a shift in frequencies for confined MHD waves and can influence the wave propagation even causing resonant flow instabilities, depending upon the direction, and strength of mass flows. Though possible effects of mass flow on wave periodicities/propagation were known theoretically, it still requires observational verification in highly localised dynamic waveguides such as solar spicules. \np
%
At multiple points through this thesis, there has been a comparison between the simulations and observations. There have been interesting features that have arisen in the synthetic jets, particularly the CSW variations and the knots. In this Chapter, we aim to focus on these aspects of the observations by comparing the CSW variations in off-limb spicules with the observed dynamical behaviour with synthetic jets and highlight observed solar features where knots may be present. \np
%-------------------------------------------
\section{Cross-sectional Width Variation in Synthetic jets}
\label{sec:CSW_syn_jet}
%-------------------------------------------
The synthetic jets used in the thesis are set up to capture the fundamental dynamics of a chromospheric jet in a stratified atmosphere. Through the momentum-driven simulated jet lacks complex physical mechanisms, like e.g. radiative losses, ambipolar diffusion, ion-neutral effects, etc., it still mimics the crucial kinematic behaviour, such as longitudinal/field-aligned plasma motions with CSW variations (Fig.~\ref{jet_P300_B50_A60}) in both rise and fall phase of the jet evolution. \np
%
Using the jet tracking code as outline in Chapter~\ref{chap:sj} the CSW have been measured for a jet with parameters of $\theta =0\degs$, $P=300~\rm{s}$, $B=50~\rm{G}$, and $A=60\kms$ (see Fig.~\ref{jet_P300_B50_A60}). The parameter of these jets is similar to that of the standard jet, and hence display similar dynamics \textit{i.e.} morphology, lifetimes, knots and CSW variations. The jet's widths are temporally tracked at multiple heights, where the blue marks measure the widths and yellow triangle locked onto the apex of the jet. The results of the widths for each megameter the jet reaches are displayed in Fig.~\ref{CSW_m_heights}. From Fig.~\ref{CSW_m_heights} there are oscillatory patterns at each height, excluding at $6~\rm{Mm}$. \np
%
We decided to focus on slit height at $2~\rm{Mm}$ as it can be compared against observations, gives a good example of the oscillatory pattern seen at the multiple heights, and gives more temporal data to analyse than higher slits. The life of a jet can be separated into two phases, the rising phase, where the jet is being driven and propagating upward, and the fall phase where the jet is no longer being driven and apex height is decreasing with time. These regions are separated by using the parabolic trajectory and calculate the point at which the gradient switched from positive to negative, i.e. the apex of the trajectory, which is marked temporally by the solid black vertical line in Fig.~\ref{CSW_2m_height}. One striking feature is seen in Fig.~\ref{CSW_2m_height}, is the discovery ({\color{green}!!Are we the first to notice that the boundary deformation is different in the rising and falling phases of a spicule jet!!}) that there are distinct differences in the behaviour of the boundary deformation for the rising (green line) and falling (cyan line) phases of the jet. During the rising phase, the CSW is larger and with a few undulations. Whereas in the fall phase the CSW are shorter and faster undulations. The blue and orange lines show the quadratic fit used to detrend the rise and fall phases, respectively in Section~\ref{sec:CSW_comp}.

\section{Observations of Cross-sectional Width Variation in Spicules}
\label{sec:CSW_spicules}
%-------------------------------------------
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:c2discussion}, SST currently offers the best spatial resolution observation of the Sun, making it an ideal telescope to use for tracking the widths of such small features as spicules. SST is a ground-based telescope located in La Palma, which has one of the best seeing conditions in the world, placed $2,400~\rm{m}$ above sea level. It has a nearly $1~\rm{m}$ sized aperture and uses active optics, to minimise data degradation due to Earth's atmospheric conditions. The data captured in this section uses the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP), which covers a wavelength range of $510$ to $860~\rm{nm}$, with a field of view of approximately $43.5\times43.5~\rm{Mm}$, and a pixel size of roughly $43~\rm{km}$. The spectral line selected for observation is H$\alpha$ $(656.3~\rm{nm})$ giving an angular resolution of approximately $95~\rm{km}$. H$\alpha$ can only form on the Sun where it is ``cool" enough for hydrogen to exist in its atomic form, which is the photosphere and chromosphere. It is part of the Balmer series and forms an absorption or emission spectra for hydrogen when the electron jumps from or falls to $n=2$. The H$\alpha$ line is commonly used for observing chromospheric structures as it reveal many complex structure in the ``messy" chromosphere \citep[\textit{etc.}]{Parmenter1966PASP78250P, von1985AA146192V, Nishikawa1988PASJ40613N, Judge2006ASPC354259J, Leenaarts2007AA473625L, Rutten2008ASPC39754R, Jess2012, Pereira2016ApJ82465P, Rutten2017AA598A89R}. \np
%
The spicules structures presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:spa},~\ref{fig:spb} and~\ref{fig:spc} where identified in observations carried out on AR NOAA AR11504 at 07:15-07:48 UT, June 21, 2012. The AR was scanned using 31 equally spaced line positions with 86 m\angstrom, steps from -1.376 to +1.29 \AA, relative to the line centre, along with the additional 4 positions in the far blue wing from -1.376 to 2.064 \AA. Following data acquisition, post-processing of data was carried out using the Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution \citep [MOMFBD;][]{2005} image restoration algorithm. Also, standard procedures available in the image pipeline for CRISP data \citep{2015} including differential stretching and removal of dark- and flat-fielding were implemented. \np
%
The processed data spans around $30~\rm{mins}$ with a cadence of $7.7~\rm{s}$. Following the Nyquist criterion, the temporal-resolution of the dataset allowed the detection of MHD wave modes with periodicities over $15.4~\rm{s}$. The selected spicules were identified as high-intensity structures with the least possible superimposition by any other surrounding features during their visible lifetime in an observed passband. The identified spicules have an average lifetime of $118~\rm{s}$ measured from the H$\alpha$ line-centre. It is possible they could live longer as spicules tend to evolve in multiple passbands, which measurements have shown to have lifetimes in the range of $500-800~\rm{s}$ \citep{Pereira2014}. The observed features have an average length of about $3\pm0.36~\rm{Mm}$ with apex reaching up to an average height of $4.83~\rm{Mm}$. \np
%
The CSW of observed spicule features were estimated using the method adopted from \citet{Sharma2018}. A single Gaussian function with linear background is used to fit the intensity profile across the observed spicules, with estimated FWHM is taken as a measure of CSW of the feature. For the selected spicules the average FWHM of the spicules measured at $2~\rm{Mm}$ is $144.47~\rm{km}$ which is comparable with other reports for off-limb spicules \citep{Sharma2018}. The spicules are resolved as there is a $3.36$ ($1.52$) pixel (angular-resolution) cover, keeping note that the intensity values belonging to the spicule will occupy a space larger than the FWHM. This process is outlined in Fig.~\ref{fig:spa}, where panels (a1)-(a4) shows snapshots of the identified spicule where the cyan line is the vertical slit to track field-aligned plasma motions and horizontal yellow slit is placed at $2~\rm{Mm}$ to track the CSW. Panel (b) displays a time-distance from the vertical slits, which is used to estimate the speed of the spicules and allows for the separation of the rise and fall phases. Panel (c) shows the process of calculating the FWHM of the spicule where the dark (light) shaded region marks the unperturbed (perturbed) width $W_u$ ($W$) during the spicule lifetime measure by the yellow slit. The unperturbed width is fixed individually for each spicule as the average FWHM calculated over its lifetime and the perturbed width is the FWHM calculated at each time step of the observations. The temporal variations in CSW are calculated with $\delta W = W(t) - W_{u}$ and were used to estimate the periodicities in the spectral domain. \np
%
The observation of SP:A in Fig.~\ref{fig:spa} is an off-limb spicule that was observed at $-1.032~\angstrom$ from the H$\alpha$ line core with a total lifetime of around $161.7~\rm{s}$. The feature had a physical length of $3.8~\rm{Mm}$ at an inclination of $21.4\degs$ over the observed limb, with apex-height reaching up to $5.3~\rm{Mm}$. The longitudinal motions in the Lagrangian frame were analyzed to estimate the velocity and duration of rising and falling phases, using a vertical slit (Fig.~\ref{fig:spa}(a1) – (a4)) along the axis of spicule structure. The time-distance analysis of the vertical slit suggests a parabolic profile (Fig. \ref{fig:spa}(b)) of mass motions with an average ascending velocity of $\sim$46.9 km/s. The plasma attains the maximum height in about 81 sec and then falls back to the surface with an average velocity of 40.2 km/s. For the observed lifetime, the average/unperturbed CSW estimate (W$_{u}$) for the spicule structure was around $176~\rm{km}$.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/fig_sp_a.png}
\caption{Panels (a1) – (a4) show the temporal evolution of candidate spicule feature (SP:A) in H$\alpha$ passband at four instances, with positions of vertical (cyan) and horizontal (yellow) slits used for the estimation of field-aligned mass flows and CSW respectively. Panel (b) shows the time-distance plot from the vertical slit on the spicule, highlighting the rise- and fall-phases of field-aligned mass flow. The maximum height attained by the visible plasma is marked with the ‘+’ symbol, along with estimated velocities (+46.9 km/s, 40.25 km/s). Bottom panel (c) shows an example of Gaussian fit for intensity magnitudes for horizontal slit location (marked as a yellow line on (a1) – (a4)), with error bars, estimated as the standard deviation for intensity values. The vertical black line marks the position of the amplitude of Gaussian fit, while shaded-regions mark average/unperturbed width (W$_{u}$) during spicule lifetime and perturbed/instantaneous width (W). This figure and analysis its encapsulates was produced by Dr. Sharma.}

\section{Comparison of Cross-sectional Width Variation in Synthetic Jets and Spicules}
\label{sec:CSW_comp}
%-------------------------------
The CSW estimates from both observation and synthetic jets indicate an oscillatory pattern during the feature’s lifetime. These were further analyzed using wavelet transform to understand the nature of periodicities and associated wave physics. The results obtained from this analysis is viewed in the framework of ideal MHD waves as this is likely how this phenomenon would be interpreted in observations. To identify any significant periodicities, wavelet power spectra (WPS) and the associated global power spectrum (GPS) are constructed using open-source software developed by \cite{Torrence1998}. The default Morlet wavelet profile was employed with a two-$\sigma$ confidence level on CSW estimates from observations (top panels) and synthetic jet (bottom panels) as shown in Fig.~\ref{WL_1}. The wavelet analysis is applied to the full signal, rise and fall phases. For the synthetic jets the rise and fall phases are independently detrended with a quadratic polynomial (see Fig~\ref{CSW_2m_height}). In addition, the detrended data is smoothed to reduce noise with a moving average with a window size of 15 and 10 for the rising and falling phases, respectively. \np
%
The peak frequencies were identified in the wavelet analysis as spectral-magnitudes in WPS with significance levels over unity and higher, highlighted as black contours in Fig.~\ref{WL_1}. Furthermore, the peaks also had GPS over two-$\sigma$ (95\%) confidence levels (orange dashed-line in Fig.~\ref{WL_1}). The wavelet spectra for observed width variations during spicule lifetime suggest a strong spectral density concentration around $17~\rm{s}$ for $5$ cycles. Interestingly, for the simulated jet structure, the WPS indicates the presence of harmonics, concentrated around $65~\rm{s}$ and $32~\rm{s}$ for $8$ and $5$ cycles, respectively. The oscillatory behaviour between the rise and falling phase is displayed in the last two columns, respectively. It becomes clear with the wavelet spectrum for both observed and simulated width estimates during their rise and fall intervals that CSW oscillations show remarkable differences in their periodicities estimated when plasma is ascending along the magnetic field, against the gravity (rise phase), and later tracing the field lines under the influence of gravity (fall phase). Wavelet transforms for observational width variations indicate approximately $27~\rm{s}$ periodicity for 3 cycles while a powerful $70~\rm{s}$ periodicity is present in both GPS and WPS of the simulation data. However, there is a noticeable shift towards lower/higher periodicities/frequencies, for two out of three of our identified spicule cases (Table \ref{table:1}), during the fall-phase of the plasma flows in the jet structure. Wavelet spectrum for observed width variations shows dominant periodicity at $16~\rm{s}$ for $5$ cycles while for simulated data, there are two strong periods, concentrated around $30~\rm{s}$ and $68~\rm{s}$, each persistent for $5$ and $2.5$ cycles. These results are consistent with previous reports for CSW oscillations in on-disk fibrils \citep{Gafeira2017}. \np
%
An important aspect of our investigation is the confirmation of the first overtone in cross-sectional width periodicities associated with dynamic waveguides (spicules) in the solar chromosphere.  Earlier studies were able to only identify higher harmonics in static waveguides (e.g., in a coronal loop), with the presence of fundamental and first overtone \citep{verwichte2004, guo2015}. Recently, the presence of a second overtone was also reported for coronal loop observations by \citet{duckenfield2019}, associated with transverse kink oscillations. It must be noted that wave harmonics can provide vital clues regarding plasma and magnetic field characteristics of the waveguide via solar magneto-seismology applications \citep{andries2005,andries2009}. The presence of overtones in jets provides a key tool for chromospheric magneto-seismology. This phenomenon is not limited to this one observation as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spb} and Fig.~\ref{fig:spc}. For a summary of the results and physical properties of all the selected spicules see Table \ref{table:1}. \np

Vertical red-line in plots (Obs: 1.1 and Sim 1.1) marks the time when the field-aligned plasma attained the apex height. Further, plots (Obs: 1.1, Sim: 3.2) provide clear indication of a second harmonic of the cross-sectional width deformations in the dynamic spicular waveguide.

\section{Blobs in Solar in jets Observations}
\label{sec:EUV_jets}
%-------------------------------------------
As stated throughout the thesis observing knot-like structures is changeling due to the current resolution limits. However, larger-scale jets take place on the Sun as overviews in Section~\ref{!!?!!} and if the flow speed is sufficient then its possible patterns of the knots may be observed. In series of studies on coronal jets blob-like structures were observed \citep{Zhang2014AA567A11Z, Zhang2016SoPh291859Z, Chen2015ApJ81571C, Chen2017ApJ84054C}.  \np
%
In \cite{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z} show multiple observations of blob structures in solar jets. The observations were captured by Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) in the Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) \citep{Howard2008SSRv13667H} package of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) \citep{Kaiser2005AdSpR361483K} and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument \citep{Lemen2012SoPh27517L}. The images in Fig.~\ref{fig_brigt_blobs_2} where observed with STEREO-B in $171~\AA$ filter with a spatial resolution approximately $2320~\rm{km}$ ($\ang{;;3.2}$) with a cadence of $75~\rm{s}$. In the example observation two jets (J1 and J2) appear to originate around a coronal bright point (BP1), which are thought to arise due to magnetic reconnection \citep{Priest1994ApJ427459P, Mandrini1996SoPh168115M, Longcope1998ApJ507433L, Santos2007ASTRA329S} and the jets flow along closed magnetic loops. J2 is particularly interesting as multiple blobs form along with the jet, which is highlighted by the white arrows in panels (f-g). If at the base of the jet there are mixed magnetic polarities, a current sheet forms between the interface of these regions and perturbation to this system can lead to magnetic reconnection. If an instability forms at this current sheet during reconnection then this can lead to plasmoids (regions of magnetic islands)\citep{Drake2006Natur443553D}. These plasmoids are proposed by \cite{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z} to explain the blobs in their jet observations. Interestingly the formation of the blobs by magnetic reconnection has been proposed for chromospheric anemone jets \citep{Singh2012ApJ75933S}, alluding this may occur over a range of scales \citep{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z}. \np 
%If the current sheet is extremely thin a perturbation to this system can cause it to go unstable and cause magnetic reconnection. This creates magnetic flux which goes onto form plasmoids which creates magnetic island \citep{Drake2006Natur443553D}. These plasmoids are proposed by by \cite{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z} to formed by a tearing-mode instability. The formation of the blobs by magnetic reconnection has been proposed for chromospheric anemone jets also \citep{Singh2012ApJ75933S}.  \np

In \cite{Chen2015ApJ81571C, Chen2017ApJ84054C} around 20 jets were observed at the west edge of AR 11513 on the 2nd and 3rd of July 2012. In these jets bright regions are seen in the jet beam (see Fig.\ref{fig_brigt_blobs_alt}). The observations were captured by the space-based observations with SDO using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. AIA has a spatial resolution of $1088~\rm{km}$ ($\ang{;;1.5}$) and a temporal resolution of $12~\rm{s}$ for the EUV lines shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_brigt_blobs_alt}. The example jet clearly shows blobs structure as highlighted by slices 1 and 2 in panel (b). The conditions under which this form is similar to that outline \cite{Zhang2014AA567A11Z, Zhang2016SoPh291859Z}, as the brightening at the base of the jet has been shown to contain magnetic fields of opposite polarities \citep{Chen2017ApJ84054C}. \np
%
The suggested mechanism of blob formation is plausible in \cite{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z}, but so too mechanism put forward in Chapter~\ref{!!?!!} for blobs/knots to form in the jet beam when the flow is sufficient. These jets move at high velocities with the apparent speeds of J1 and J2 in Fig~\ref{fig_brigt_blobs_2} are $145\pm15\kms$ and $203\pm\kms$ \citep{Zhang2016SoPh291859Z} and jet in Fig.~\ref{fig_brigt_blobs_alt} is approximately $200\kms$ \citep{Chen2017ApJ84054C}. Based on the results of the carried out simulations in the thesis it's entirely feasible with these high speeds in a coronal environment for the blob formation to be created by shocks containing waves trapped in a jet beam. To rule out blobs forming due to shocks, one needs to establish the flow rate of the jet, as if continuous flow then shock base method is plausible or if it’s a short burst of flow then instabilities forming during magnetic reconnection is more likely.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
\label{sec:sum}
%============================================================
This Chapter compares the CSW properties of the synthetic jets with three observations of spicules captured with high-resolution CRISP/SST H$\alpha$ data. For both the simulation and observation wave behaviour is identified by CSW estimates. Using a wavelet transform of time series CSW show the effects of plasma flows on estimated periods. The Chapter discusses the possibilities that blob structures in larger solar jets observations could be knots produced by trapped shocks waves in the jet. The main conclusion drawn from the results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{CSW variations in observed and synthetic jets highlight the observed behaviour as a fundamental property of spicule jets. Earlier reports interpreted these variations as a consequence of confined sausage waves in chromospheric jet structures, though similar characteristics are also shown by MHD fluting wave modes. Here, for the first time, an alternate explanation is provided in terms of internal shock waves for cross-sectional deformations of chromospheric waveguides. In Chapter~\ref{!!?!!} it has been highlighted that this phenomenon occurs over a whole range of jets with vastly different length scales, \textit{e.g.} from astrophysical to laboratory jets. It should be noted that boundary deformation behaviour is an intrinsic physical characteristic of jets with fast flow speeds, however, lacked attention for solar jets, primarily due to observational/instrumental constraints.}

    \item{Spectral analysis using wavelet transform suggests noticeable modulation in estimated periodicities for the CSW in both observed and synthetic jet structure. In most cases, periodicities tend to shift towards lower magnitudes during the fall phase of the plasma in the jet, as compared to the momentum-pulse driven rise phase. Similar effects were reported in the past for changes in linear MHD wave characteristics due to mass flows in theoretical and prominence studies.}

    \item{For the first time, the first overtone in the estimated periodicity is identified in both observed and simulated dynamic chromospheric waveguide (spicule). This could have important implications for chromospheric magneto-seismology, further enabling the estimation of much needed longitudinal plasma and magnetic field information for chromospheric jets.}
    
    \item{Knot formation could be an alternative explanation for blob structures reported in larger solar jets.}
\end{itemize}
%
This Chapter indicates the possible coupling between the longitudinal mass motions and CSW variations in spicule structures. Understanding such behaviour is crucial for the accurate estimation of the overall energy budget and associated dissipation mechanisms. Furthermore, simulations suggest the formation of knot substructures within the jet beam, prevalent during the rise-phase of plasma density. These substructures were closely linked with the estimated CSW variations in the jet and could be generated due to the superimposition of shock waves. The simulation results should inform observers to be cautious attributing CSW variation in fast-flowing jets as being due to sausage waves as there other mechanisms (\textit{e.g.} shock waves occurring in supersonic flows) that can have a sausage-like appearance. \np
%
For the larger scale EUV jets, it should be noted regardless of formation mechanisms of blob/knot in the jet beam, they can occur over a whole range of scales in jets. Due to this factor, it is in my view likely that with the increase in spatial observation on the horizon for spicules, that only matter of time for knot structures to be observed in spicular jets.
