abstract = {We consider finite volume methods for the numerical solution of conservation laws. In order to achieve high-order accurate numerical approximation to non-linear smooth functions, we introduce a new class of limiter functions for the spatial reconstruction of hyperbolic equations. We therefore employ and generalize the idea of double-logarithmic reconstruction of Artebrant and Schroll [R. Artebrant, H.J. Schroll, Limiter-free third order logarithmic reconstruction, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 28 (2006) 359-381]. The result is a class of efficient third-order schemes with a compact three-point stencil. The interface values between two neighboring cells are obtained by a single limiter function. The limiter belongs to a family of functions, which are based upon a non-polynomial and non-linear reconstruction function. The new methods handle discontinuities as well as local extrema within the standard semi-discrete TVD-MUSCL framework using only a local three-point stencil and an explicit TVD Runge–Kutta time-marching scheme. The shape-preserving properties of the reconstruction are significantly improved, resulting in sharp, accurate and symmetric shock capturing. Smearing, clipping and squaring effects of classical second-order limiters are completely avoided. Computational efficiency is enhanced due to large allowable Courant numbers (CFL≲1.6), as indicated by the von Neumann stability analysis. Numerical experiments for a variety of hyperbolic partial differential equations, such as Euler equations and ideal magneto-hydrodynamic equations, confirm a significant improvement of shock resolution, high accuracy for smooth functions and computational efficiency.},

@article{DEDNER2002645,
abstract = {In simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes the violation of the divergence constraint causes severe stability problems. In this paper we develop and test a new approach to the stabilization of numerical schemes. Our technique can be easily implemented in any existing code since there is no need to modify the solver for the MHD equations. It is based on a modified system in which the divergence constraint is coupled with the conservation laws by introducing a generalized Lagrange multiplier. We suggest a formulation in which the divergence errors are transported to the domain boundaries with the maximal admissible speed and are damped at the same time. This corrected system is hyperbolic and the density, momentum, magnetic induction, and total energy density are still conserved. In comparison to results obtained without correction or with the standard “divergence source terms,” our approach seems to yield more robust schemes with significantly smaller divergence errors.},

@article{Edgington-Mitchell2014,
abstract = {High resolution planar particle image velocimetry is used to measure turbulent quantities in the region downstream of the Mach disk in an axisymmetric underexpanded jet issuing from a convergent nozzle. The internal annular shear layer generated by the slip line emanating from the triple point is shown to persist across multiple shock cells downstream. A triple decomposition based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition shows that the external helical structure associated with the screech tone generated by the jet exerts a strong influence on velocity fluctuations in the initial region of the annular shear layer. This influence manifests as the external vortices producing oscillatory motion of the Mach disk, and thus a forcing of the internal annular shear layer. The internal shear layer is characterized by a number of azimuthal modes of varying wavenumber and type, including both helical and axisymmetric modes. Finally, the possibility of a previously hypothesized recirculation region behind the Mach disk is investigated, with no evidence found to support its existence.},

@article{Ono2014,
abstract = {Plasma jets have been used widely in various fields such as materials and aerospace engineering. The understanding of the shock structure is important to control a supersonic jet using a magnetic field. An experiment of axisymmetric argon plasma jet under strong magnetic field was carried out to detect the shock structure around the Mach disk precisely. A magnetic field was applied to the jet using a pair of identical superconducting coils. The jet images in a vacuum chamber were taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera with high spatial and color resolution through a viewing window. The distribution of light intensity from photographic data was converted to the radial intensity, relevant to plasma density, using Abel-inversion. The radial shock structure, that is not apparent on the ordinary photos, can be detected from the converted distributions. The software for the analysis was developed to detect the shock structure in the plasma jet. The method of shock detection was also detailed. The hidden shock characteristics such as triple point were found using the radial intensity obtained from the data with high color resolution. The shock lines upstream of the Mach disk under the magnetic field were indicated in detail. The reflected shock location could be determined. The intensity distribution downstream of the Mach disk was significantly changed by applying the magnetic field. The interaction between plasma density and magnetic field clearly occurs at higher density region downstream of the Mach disk.},

@article{Menon2010,
abstract = {An experimental and numerical study of underexpanded free sonic jet flows issuing from rectangular, elliptical and slot nozzles has been undertaken. Aspect ratios (AR) of 1, 2, and 4 are described at pressure ratios (exit plane pressure to ambient pressure), of 2 and 3. There is good qualitative agreement between the experimental observations and the numerical predictions. In the case of rectangular jets, a complex system of shock waves forming the incident shock system is identified. This shock wave system originates at the corners of the nozzle exits, and proceeds downstream. Mach reflections are found to occur on the incident shock wave surface as well as the presence of a Mach disk terminating the first jet cell. This Mach disk has the shape of a square, a hexagon, or an octagon depending on the nozzle shape. For slot and elliptical jets, the formation of the incident shock wave was not observed along the minor axis plane of the nozzle for AR {\textgreater} 2. The incident shock wave was observed to originate downstream of the nozzle exit in the major axis plane. This wave system undergoes a transition to Mach reflection as it propagates downstream of the nozzle exit. In all cases tested, the shape of the jet boundary is significantly distorted. In rectangular jets, the narrowing of the jet boundary along the diagonal axis of the nozzle exit is observed, and in the case of the elliptical and slot jets axis switching is noted. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},
