I would like to offer my thanks to the various people and institutions that have made the successful completion of this thesis possible.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my two supervisors, Professors R\'obert Erd\'elyi and Michael S. Ruderman, for the guidance and insight they offered me throughout my PhD.
I would also like to thank Professor Tom Van Doorsselaere for his contributions to the project that became Chapter 3 of this thesis, and for being a gracious host during my visit to KU Leuven.

I am deeply indebted to my partner, Br\^{i}ndu\cb{s}a, who shared my enthusiasm about science and supported me through the most difficult parts of my PhD.
You shared my highs and my lows, you gave me hope and things to look forward to.
For this, and so much more, I dedicate this thesis to you.

I am equally indebted to my family, for their love and support through the years.
Without you, none of this would have been possible.

I'd like to thank my friends and colleagues for all the help they gave me throughout my degree.
Stevie, Freddie, Matt and Ellie for being there when the maths was confusing.
Chris, Rahul, Norbi and Tamas for explaining time and again how the Sun works.
Ben and Fin for introducing me to the fascinating world of MHD simulations.
Stuart and Drew for all your help with coding.
Thank you all.

I'd also like to thank my close friends (some of you again) for making the past few years a lovely experience.
Thank you Ellie, Ben, Freddie, Hope, Alex, Comi and Reza, for letting me be a part of your lives and for putting up with my antics for so long.
To the rest of my friends not mentioned here, I appreciate you all.

In order to give credit where credit is due, I offer my thanks to all the staff of Interval, The University Arms, The Washington, and all other establishments that I frequented throughout my PhD.
Your service turned good times great and made bad times bearable.

Finally, I acknowledge the funding received from the UK's Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC) and the EU's Erasmus Programme that allowed me to undertake this degree.
