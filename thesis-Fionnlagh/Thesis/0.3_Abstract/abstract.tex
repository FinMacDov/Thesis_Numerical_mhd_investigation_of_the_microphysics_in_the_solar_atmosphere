Magnetoacoustic waves are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere.
The properties of their propagation, as well as the possibility that they may trigger magnetohydrodynamic instabilities must have a strong theoretical interpretation in order to better our understanding of solar phenomena.
In this Thesis, we develop two new models of magnetoacoustic wave propagation and we study the conditions for the triggering of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in each case.
