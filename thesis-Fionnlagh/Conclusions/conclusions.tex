\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}
%-------------------------------
The thesis aimed to investigate the fundamental dynamics and morphology of spicular jets. A simple model is deployed with a idealised solar atmosphere and a vertical uniform magnetic field, but with a high spatial resolution. There have been many numerical approaches to modelling spicules, with very few reports of CSW variations. In this thesis we have presented one of the few models that obtained both the transverse and horizontal dynamics, as well as fine structures of spicule. We take a novel approach of treating the spicules as a transfer of mass, by driving with a momentum pulse. In Chapter~\ref{chap:sj} vertical jet launching was investigated. An extensive parameter space was investigated that determined spicule dynamics and morphology are sensitive to the parameter related to the driver (lifetimes and initial amplitude) and magnetic environment (magnetic field strength). The vertical and horizontal evolution of spicules are measured  with our own automated jet tracking software. Using this we show that we capture main observable features of spicules with the synthetic jets, as we similar heights, speeds, widths and trajectories. We report on complex fine structures in the jet beam of a spicules due to shock waves, which also create symmetrical deformation of the jet boundary. these fine structures are yet to be observed, and we show that higher resolution observations may be necessary to identify the fine structures. \np
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:tilted_jets} continued to study with the same model for launching jets, but explored what effect does the misalignment between the direction of the driver and the magnetic field have on the synthetic jet. We showed even with small tilts angles of $5\%$ have significant impact on the jets morphology and fine structures. The tilt in the jet flows introduces more interest dynamics than that seen in Chapter~\ref{chap:sj}, with transverse displacement of the jet, whip motions, and redistribution of the density in the jet beam. An interesting results is that only jets with small misalignment is it visually notable that there is mixture of CSW variations with the transverse displacement, as high tilt angle the transverse motion dominates. We tentatively put forward that the whip motion seen the jet is possible a consequence of a DKI. We show how the jet trajectory and CSWs vary with tilt, as well as highlight the importance of properly tracking the central axis of the jet for width measurements. \np

chapter 5 we revisit the straight jets, but make more efforts to compare with observations. \np

\section{Future Work}
\label{sect:fut_work}
%-------------------------------
There are multiple improvements that can undertaken to build upon the existing work in this thesis. Steps that need to undertaken to blur lines between numerical simulation and observations are as follows. Spicules are 3D objects, therefore a 2D model we may be missing import dynamics, for example torsional motions which is thought to occur in spicular jets \citep{dePontieu2012ApJ752L12D}, and in astrophysical jets its possible for RTI to form at boundary in 3D simulations jet for fast moving jets \citep{Matsumoto772L1M}. A 3D simulation would better capture the dynamical motion of the spicules and may yield interesting results for the behavior of the boundary deformation. All the simulations in this thesis use a simplified solar atmosphere, it would be more appropriate to base the atmospheric stratification one semi-empirical data such as VALC or C7 atmospheric model \citep{Vernazza1981ApJS45635V,Avrett2008ApJS175229A}. More complex physics could be added, radiate transfer and heat conduction are important to include as they can impact the final height of the spicules \citep{Sterling1990ApJ349647S}. These additional physics are key if we wish to study the synthetic jets contribution to chromospheric/coronal heating. Carrying out a two fluid model of the simulation could be another avenue to investigate, as neutral could place an important role in spicule dynamics \citep{kuzma2017ApJ84978K}. Another direction to investigate would be to try different magnetic filed configurations, I think it would be very interesting to see how an expanding flux tube would impact the presence of the knots. One major improvement of the model, particularly useful for comparing to observations would be to use forward modeling to convert the parameter of the simulation into observables. For example the FoMo code \citep{Doorsselaere2016FrASS34V}, is set up to accept MPI-AMRVAC data structures. Forward modelling would allow for more concrete comparison to observations and may allows us to pick out potential observational signatures for the jet phenomena simulated throughout the thesis. \np

We are at the beginning of the next generation of solar telescopes with mirror sizes approximately four times that of SST, such as DKIST  which recently release the highest resolution image of Sun's surface to date and allowed us to see features as small as $30~\rm{km}$, and EST with first light planned in $2026$. When data becomes available from these telescope, they should be used to advance our knowledge of the fine structuring of the spicules and hopefully pin down their driving mechanism to allow to narrow down the appropriate numerical model to capture their characteristics.
