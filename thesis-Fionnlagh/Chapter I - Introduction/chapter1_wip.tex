The motivation for my work is to conduct numerical model to research into the effects of spicules on the transition region, particularly focusing on whether spicules are the drivers of TRQs \citep{Scullion2011}. We are interested in spicules (solar jets) as these jets are ubiquitous ($100,000$  at  any  time \citep{Beckers1968}) on the Sun, thus are a good candidate for coronal heating. These jets could perturb the transition region (a thin region of approximately $100$ km between the chromosphere and corona where the temperature raises from $10^4$ K to $1$-$2$ MK) causing it to oscillate (akin to when a drum is struck), thus possibly being the cause of Transition Region Quakes (TRQ). TRQ are energetic waves in the transition region that evolves in a similar manner to waves on 2D elastic waveguides. When a solar jet rises up from the photosphere to corona it will cause the Transition region to ripple and thus perturb the surrounding magnetic fields. The goal is to analyse the waves and the energy involved in these waves to investigate if they could significantly contribute to coronal heating. \\ \\ The discovery of a link between these TRQ and Rapid Blueshifted Excursions (RBE) identified in CRISP H-alpha data is potentially very far reaching. Work by \cite{Henriques2016} has already found convincing evidence of links between RBEs and coronal transient events, however they did not study whether their coronal features corresponded to coherent waves (i.e. TRQ manifesting as propagating wave fronts). This task is vital for expanding our knowledge of the coupling between the lower solar atmosphere and the transition region. \\ \\ The importance of small-scale jets is well known as they are suggested to contribute to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Spicules themselves may be triggered by magnetic reconnection \citep{Pontieu2007PASJ} or waves \citep{Pontieu2004Natur}. Although, it is currently unclear what the decisive physical factors that trigger spicules, reconnection and waves are both promising candidates for their contribution to the energy exchange between the lower cool atmosphere and the corona. We also observe apparent transverse motion within spicules and intermittent Doppler-shifts in coronal loops could be evidence in support of the existence of \Alfven or kink waves in the solar atmosphere.  \\ \\
Observations have demonstrated the ubiquity of vortex motions present in the solar atmosphere. These are usually found at photospheric Magentic Bright points (MBP) groups. Previous MHD simulations have shown such vortices could be responsible for the generation of various types of MHD waves, yet their relationship with other ubiquitous transients-jets (spicules) is unclear.

\section{Overview and Motivation}
\label{sec:overview}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many mysterious about the Sun that remain to be unlocked, two relevant to this thesis are: how does the Sun maintain one million degree corona?; what drives and supplies mass to the solar wind? This thesis unfortunately does not provide the answer to these questions, but does increase our understanding of solar spicular jets that are main candidate in accounting for these phenomenon. \np 
%
Our main interest lies in small scale jets such as classical/type I spicules, dynamic fibrils and mottles. We seek to understand what are the dynamics of small jets by deploying simple numerical models. By using simple models we can identify the fundamental nature of these features. Parameter spaces are investigated for key parameters to study how sensitive the dynamics and morphology of spicular jets are to different environments. There have been numerous numerical studies on these jets. However, typically they focus on initiation mechanism and the vertical dynamics (e.g. heights reaches, speeds, trajectory, \textit{etc}). However, these jets are not just vertically dynamic, but are host of complex motion both in the vertical and horizontal directions. In the literature there few studies on the horizontal dynamics of spicules and this may be due to need for very high resolution to study this phenomenon, but with next generation of solar telescopes around the corner (\textit{e.g. DKIST and EST}), more research should come to pass on the cross-sectional evolution of small scale solar jets. This thesis embarks on highlighting the dynamics that they may be observed in these future studies.
%-------------------
%The motivation for my work is to construct a model that accurately simulates waves in the Transition region. We are interested in spicules (solar jets) as these jets are ubiquitous ($100,000$  at  any  time \citep{Beckers1968}) on the Sun, thus are a good candidate for coronal heating. These jets could perturb the transition region (a thin region of approximately $100$ km between the chromosphere and corona where the temperature raises from $10^4$ K to $1$-$2$ MK) causing it to oscillate (akin to when a drum is struck). When a solar jet rises up from the photosphere to corona it will cause the Transition region to ripple and thus perturb the surrounding magnetic fields. The goal is to analyses the waves and the energy involved in these waves to investigate if they could significantly contribute to coronal heating. \np
%
%My research for my PhD is to construct models using numerical magnetohydronamics (MHD) to investigate these dynamics that occur in the solar atmosphere. MHD is combination of the Navier$–$Stokes equation of fluid dynamics and Maxwell equations of electromagnetism. It describes the motion of magnetic field in the presence of electromagnetic fields, which is well suited for describing the dynamics of plasma in the solar atmosphere. One of main problems that have puzzled scientist for over 70 years is the coronal heating problem. This problem refers to observations that the temperature from the core of the Sun to the photosphere decreases as one would expect and the corona which is the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere (i.e. furthest away from the nuclear reaction in the core) then logically this would be the coldest, however, the corona is 200 times hotter than the photosphere. This contradiction is referred to as the coronal heating problem. One candidate to explain coronal heating is based on magnetically driven waves. We know that these waves carry significant amount of energy, enough to heat and maintain the corona. However, these waves are not easily dissipated into heat energy. The challenge is to find mechanisms in which the energy in these waves are converted into heat energy.  \np

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Sun}
\label{sec:Sun}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sun is often referred to as a mundane star by the larger astrophysical community as it is a common main sequence star (G-type), particular when its compared against the zoo of exotic astrophysical objects \textit{e.g.} stars in Binary systems, Neutron stars, Red Giants, White Dwarfs, Cepheids, Wolf-Rayet stars, \textit{etc.}. However, one of the most fascinating aspects of the Sun is its the magnetic. To quote Robert Leighton, ``If the sun had no magnetic field, it would be as interesting as most astronomers think it is". The magnetic field makes the Sun a truly a dynamics star as it molds and shapes its atmospheric environment \textit{e.g.} coronal loops, prominence's, Rosettes, fibrils, Helmet streamers \textit{etc.}, as well store energy which can be released in dramatic fashion \textit{e.g.} coronal mass ejections, spicules, EUV jets \textit{etc.} Due high resolutions observations observers can fantastic images of these dynamics with both ground and space based instruments such as Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), Swedish Solar telescope (SST). The combination of the Sun's magnetic field and it being only star we can fully resolved gives us a marvellous space laboratory at our astronomical door step from which the physics of other stars can be understood. An overview of the basic properties of the Sun taken from \cite{priest2014magnetohydrodynamics}:
Age: $4.6 \times 10^9$ years. \\
Mass: $M_{\odot}= 1.99 \times 10^{30}$ kg. \\
Radius: $R_{\odot} = 6.96 \times 10^5$ km. \\
Surface temperature: $5785$ K. \\
Mean density: $1.4 \times 10^3$ kg m$^{-3}$. \\
Mean distance from Earth: $1$ AU = $1.5 \times 10^8$ km. \\
Surface gravity: $g_{0}=274$ m s$^-2$. \\
Equatorial Rotation Period: $26$ days. \\
Composition: $90 \%$ H, $10 \%$ He, $0.1 \%$ other elements.     \np
%
The Sun has multiple concentric layers as seen in Fig. \ref{on_model}. The Sun is powered in its core where nuclear reactions consume hydrogen to form helium. From these reactions energy is released which ultimately leaves the surface as visible light. The next layer which surrounds the core is the radiative zone where energy generated by the nuclear fusion in the core moves outwards as electromagnetic radiation. The next significant region is the convective zone where the method the energy transportation changes from radiative to convective. This occurs because as you move away from the heat source that is the core the temperature drops as described by the second law of thermodynamics. The temperature is eventually sufficiently low for heavier ions (e.g carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium and iron) retain a collection of their electrons, which increases the opacity. This makes the radiation transport less efficient and consequently traps heat. This creates hot rising gas bubbles that when they reach the surface they cool and begin to drop to the bottom of the convection zone, where they are then reheated, thus repeating the process. The next layer of the Sun is the photosphere, which is the observable surface. \np
%
An interesting aspect of stars is that they are all ``ringing" as they are a host of multiple standing waves. Just as Earth quakes have been studied to probe the interior properties of our planet \textit{e.g.} discovering the Earth has a liquid outer core and solid inner core \citep{Lehmann1936}, the principle is the same with stars. When ignoring the effect of rotation and magnetism, these star quakes for the Sun have two main restoring forces, buoyancy (gravity) or pressure \citep{Appourchaux2010AARv18197A}. \np
%
For those pulsation modes which are dominately restored by buoyancy are refereed to as gravity or g-modes. These g-modes are mostly contained to the core, but propagate through the radiative zone. Hence, studying these waves would give us crucial information about the structure and dynamics of the deepest most parts the Sun, that we otherwise can't directly measure. These waves are not able to travel into the convective zone because of their restoring force, hence in the convection zone they are exponentially damped. This makes it very challenging to detect in the Sun and despite claims of their observations \citep{ Garc2007Sci3161591G, Fossat2017AA604A40F, Fossat2018AA612L1F}, they have been met with skepticism \citep{Appourchaux2010AARv18197A, Schunker2018SoPh29395S,Appourchaux2019AA624A106A, Scherrer2019ApJ87742S}. \np
%
For pulsation modes where pressure is the restoring force, these are known as pressure or p-modes. The p-modes on the Sun where first discovered by \cite{Leighton1962ApJ135474L} found undulations on the Sun with periods near 5 minutes, refereed to in many studies as the ``5-minute oscillation". The depth at which p-modes penetrates depends on the the waves frequency low frequency propagate deep into the interior of the Sun and high frequencies are trapped to the surface. There are approximately $10^6$ resonant p-modes on the Sun, with periods ranging from minutes to hours. As they are pressure waves they freely travel through the convection zone. However, when p-modes are propagating through the stellar interior the encounter a temperature gradient and hence a sound speed gradient. The deeper the wave probes the faster the sound speeds is, this means its refracted back to the surface. Then due to a sudden jump in conditions at the surface of a the Sun such as density and pressure this acts as a solid boundary that wave can't escape and is reflected back inwards. However, there are regions (\textit{e.g.} intergranular lanes) where it is thought p-mode wave leakage occurs which propagate upwards into the solar atmosphere and drivers solar features \citep{Suematsu1990LNP367211S, Pontieu2005ApJ624L61D, Heggland2007ApJ6661277H, Pontieu2004Natur}. \np

\section{The Solar Atmosphere}
\label{sec:sol_atmos}
%-----------------------------------------------
The Sun's atmosphere is truly a complex and fascinating environment. It broadly can be split into three main regions from the top down, the corona, transition region (TR), and Chromosphere. Two main factor which separates these regions is their measure temperature (see Fig.~\ref{t_profile_sun}) and plasma beta (see Fig.~\ref{beta_profile_sun}). 
%T_regoins
\mfig{0.725}{figures/T_regoins}{Plot of the temperature and density from the photosphere to the corona. Plot taken from \cite{Lang_2006ses}.}{t_profile_sun}
%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Corona}
\label{ssec:corona}
%--------------------------------------------------
The Corona is the Sun's upper atmosphere that continually extends reaching approxiamtely tens of million of kilometres into space. It following the Sun's magnetic field lines which eventually feeds into the solar wind. It is possible to observe the corona with the naked eyes during eclipses as seen in fig. \ref{corona_image}. Otherwise to observe the corona a coronagraph is needed, which is a disk shaped instrument place on telescopes that can produce an artificial eclipse by blocking the light from the photosphere. The solar corona is the hot tenuous magnetised outer atmosphere of the Sun with an average temperature of $1-2~\rm{MK}$, but can even reach $10~\rm{MK}$. The high temperature of the corona is evidenced by the presence of ions with many electrons removed from the atom. This is evidenced by atoms such as iron which is $9-13$ times ionised in the corona, which indicate temperatures of $1.3~\rm{MK}$ and $2.3~\rm{MK}$, respectively \citep{narayanan2014introduction}. Despite its high temperature, it has a low amount of heat as it is very rarefied, with densities of the order of $10^{-12}~\rm{kg~m^{-3}}$ \citep{priest2014magnetohydrodynamics}. This in turn means that the energy density of the corona is much lower than that of the lower layers of the solar atmosphere, e.g. the photosphere where temperature is approximately $5000~{K}$. In spite of this the quiet Sun needs to have a constant energy input of $1.1-1.6~\rm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ \citep{Sakurai2017PJAB9387S} to maintain observed coronal temperatures. \np
%
One startling fact is the extreme coronal temperatures which are higher than lower regions of the atmosphere (approx. $10^4~\rm{K}$) and photosphere (approx $5,000~\rm{K}$). Intuitively, the temperature profile shown in Fig.~\ref{t_profile_sun} doesn't make sense, as the temperature is increasing with distances from the Sun's heat source (the core), breaking the second law of thermodynamics. This is known as the ``coronal heating problem", which was discovered by \cite{Grotrian1939} and \cite{Edl1943}. The coronal heating problem encompasses many open questions such as: Why is the corona hot?; How does it maintain this heat?; Is the corona heated everywhere, or is heat produced in separate, bomb-like events?; Is it heated in multiple different ways? Many theories have been put forward that boil down to either wave based: \textit{e.g.} acoustic shocks and MHD waves \citep{Alfv1947MNRAS107211A, Uchida1974SoPh35451U, Wentzel1974SoPh39129W, Priest1998Natur393545P, Antolin2008IAUS247279A, Escande2019NatSR914274E} or reconnection: \textit{e.g.} nanoflares \citep{Parker1988ApJ330474P, Cargill1993SoPh147263C, Parnell2000ApJ529554P, Klimchuk2001ApJ553440K,  Cargill2004ApJ605911C, Antolin2021NatAs554A}. Due to highly dynamic nature of the atmosphere in reality both types of heating probably occur \citep{Parnell2012RSPTA3703217P}. \np
%
The heating process can be broken into three main phases: (1) the generation of a carrier of energy (\textit{i.e.} photospheric driving motions); (2) the transport of energy into the solar atmosphere; (3) the dissipation of this energy in various structures of the atmosphere \citep{Wentzel1974SoPh39129W, Robert2004AG45d34E}. For (1-3) there is a plethora of choices, but the main challenge lies in (3). There agreement in the field that Sun's magnetic field plays a key role \citep{Parnell2012RSPTA3703217P, Arregui2015RSPTA37340261A}, but the exact physical process that transports the energy from the photosphere upwards and dissipates the magnetic energy into heat, currently remain elusive. Another key obstacle is resolving (3), as for wave heating is the dampening time of the waves are roughly proportional the magnetic Reynolds number. The magnetic Reynolds number is approximately  $10^{14}$ under solar conditions as dependent on the typical length scales of plasma flow, which is large on the Sun. Therefore, in the solar environment the challenge is finding mechanisms that generate small scales length (e.g. resonant absorption, phase mixing, plasma inhomogeneities), otherwise the wave energy won't be covered into heat quick enough compared to the coronal cooling timescales \citep{Doorsselaere2020SSRv216140V}. For reconnection/nano-flares heating by a series of small-scale reconnection events, lacks definitive observations \citep{Parnell2012RSPTA3703217P}. It possible that small scale solar jets, such as spicules play an important role in coronal heating due to their dynamic nature, which is discussed later on.

%fffffffffffffffffffff
%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Transition region}
\label{ssec:TR}
%--------------------------------------------------
The Transition region (TR) is a thin area of approximately $5,000~\rm{km}$ \citep{Athay1981NASSP45085A} that sharply links the ``cool" chromosphere ($10^{5}~\rm{K}$) to the hot corona ($1~\rm{MK}$) at around $2~\rm{Mm}$ above the solar surface \citep{Lang_2006ses}. The TR is dynamically important to the Sun's atmosphere. Due to the sharp change at the TR waves propagating through the chromophere can suddenly steepen into shocks waves, that propagate both upwards into the corona, as well reflected back into the chromosphere \citep{Pontieu2005ApJ624L61D, Hansteen2007ASPC369193H, Yuan_2016ApJS, Zhenyong2018ApJ85565H}. These shocks wave can lead to jet-like event \citep{Heggland2007ApJ6661277H, kuz2017ApJ, Pontieu2005ApJ624L61D, De_Pontieu2007ApJ}, as well as oscillation of the TR interface itself, referred to TRQ, that may transfer energy to surrounding magnetic structures \citep{Scullion2011}. A key aspect to note is that all energy that heats the corona and drivers the solar wind must make it journey through this sudden change in environment \citep{Mariska1992strbookM}.     
%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Chromosphere}
\label{ssec:Chromosphere}
%--------------------------------------------------
The chormosphere roughly spans from above the photosphere up to $2~\rm{Mm}$ \citep{Lang_2006ses}. In ancient times the chromosphere only faintly seen as a reddy-pink glow around the boundaries of a Solar eclipse. This rosy colour originates from Balmer series of transition for hydrogen emission (H$\alpha$). The atmospheric conditions of the chromospheric are sufficient to cause a quantum transition between the $N=3$ and $2$ energy levels of hydrogen. In the modern age we can study the chromosphere in great detail thanks to excellent ground and space base telescope (See Fig.~\ref{messy_chromo}). The chromosphere is typically observsed in the H$\alpha$, CaII H, and CaII H K lines \citep{Ayres2019sgspbook27A}. Observstion in these spectral lines shed light on why the chromoshpere can be described as the "Magnetic Complexity Zone" \citep{Ayres2009astro2010S9A}, due to numerous complex dynamics and structures its host as displayed in Fig.~\ref{messy_chromo}. \np  
%
Together the TR and chromosphere make up the so-called interface region, which encapsulates a area of complex plasma and magnetic fields, which transports matter and energy between the photosphere and the corona. To understand the dynamics and topography of the magnetic field lines, its important to establish whether gas or magnetic pressure is dominant. This is represented by plasma beta ($\beta$ ratio between gas and magnetic pressure) and its value in the atmosphere is shown by the grey shaded region in Fig.~\ref{beta_profile_sun}. In the photosphere where gas pressure is dominant ($\beta>1$) the magnetic field get dragged get dragged by granular flows, being pinched together as they emanating between granular lanes. At the boundary of supergranular lanes the magnetic field lines form a larger network and the field lines stem out flux tubes (MTF) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chromo_Cart}. These MFT expand further up in the atmosphere due to dropping gas pressure, where magnetic pressure becomes dominant and the field lines become frozen into the plasma \citep{Ayres2009astro2010S9A}. An interesting region in the chromosphere is where $\beta=1$. In this region the sound speed and the \Alfven speed are equal, dividing the solar atmosphere into magnetic and non-magnetic regions \citep{Tsiropoula2012}. This region can lead to formation of shocks as it allows for the mode-coupling of purely magnetic waves (\Alfven waves) with magnetoacoustic waves \citep{Hollweg1982SoPh7535H, Rosenthal2002ApJ564508R,Bogdan2003ApJ599626B, Cally2008SoPh251251C, Wang2020ApJ891110W} and has a chaotic topology which forms the canopy observed in H$\alpha$ lines (see Fig.~\ref{messy_chromo} and canopy domain in Fig.~\ref{fig:chromo_Cart}). The magnetic field in the Chromosphere is highly twisted and entangled as consequence of these transitions of the $\beta$. \np
%
In recent years the correctness of the term "coronal heating problem" has been called into question, and even label as a ``paradoxical misnomer" by \cite{Aschwanden2007ApJ}. This is because there is no direct evidence of local heating in the coronal, and researchers should focus shift their focus to how solve heat is transported from the interface region into the upper atmosphere \citep{Aschwanden2007ApJ}. It is not clear how the transport and heating occurs between the interface regoin and corona. The answer may lie in the the multiple jet features such as spicules, mottles, and dynamics fibrils, that are prevalent in the interface region, that energetically advance through the atmosphere \citep{Tsiropoula2012}. In particular spicules are hypothesised to be strong candidate for a transport mechanisms to heat the atmosphere \citep{Kudoh1999ApJ514493K, Pontieu2007PASJ, Kudoh2008IAUS247195K, Martinez-Sykora2017,Moore2011ApJ731L18M, Pontieu2017ApJ, Samanta2019Sci, Zuo2019AcASn, Bale2019Natur}.

\section{Jets in the Solar atmosphere}
\label{sec:spicule-jets}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The study of jets on the sun is over a $150$ years old with Father Angelo Secchi first observed jets in the chromosphere in the 1870's in Observatory of Roman Collegium and described them as ``burning fields" (see example in Fig.~\ref{de_flammes}). It took nearly 100 years after Secchi discovery of spicules for researcher to realise the sheer variety of jets that exist in the solar atmosphere \citep{Raouafi2016}. This started with modern observations in 1970s where the discovery of coronal transients in Fe XIV, macrospicules and explosive events \citep{Demastus1973, Bohlin1975ApJ197L133B, Withbroe1976ApJ, Brueckner1980HiA}. This active decade because because of launching of the space station Skylab and its capability of carrying EUV observations. More types jets where discovered in the 1990s, due to observations with space based Yohkoh soft x-ray telescope. \cite{Shibata1992PASJ} and {Strong1992PASJ} discovered of solar x-ray jets which are the largest and most energetic of the coronal jets, and even new jets are being discovered recently \citep{Cho2019ApJ884L38C}. \np
%
Due to many excellent observations its clear that solar jets are omnipresent at all times on the sun regardless of the phase of the solar cycle and there is a vast variety of types of jets, occurring across a whole range of scales. No more is this true than the chromosphere which is dominated by spicular jets which are thin small-scaled, short lived jet structures, rapidly evolving with time and height. These spicular jets occur everywhere from quiet sun (QS) \citep{Pontieu2007astroph2081D,Rouppe2007ApJ660L169R,Pereira2012,Pereira2014ApJ}, around active regions (ARs) \citep{Pontieu2007astroph2081D,Pereira2012,Rouppe2013ApJ77656R,Gafeira2017ApJS2296G} and coronal holes (CHs) \citep{Yamauchi2005ApJ629572Y,Moreno2008ApJ673L211M,Pereira2012,Young2015ApJ801124Y}.  These transients events could make significant contributions to the coronal heating and solar wind acceleration which to this day are unanswered questions \citep{Martinez-Sykora2017, Pontieu2017ApJ, Samanta2019Sci, Zuo2019AcASn, Bale2019Natur}. \np
%------------------ add else where
{\color{green} !!add else where!! }These jets change in appearance when observed in different spectral lines and in dependence from site they appear leading to whole range of names have to describe the jet-like phenomena, such as dynamic fibrils, mottles and spicules. It possible some of these jets are the same phenomenon, but due to uncertainty have been given different labels. Comparisons of properties and behaviors of jet-like structures which make up the chromosphere show a similarity of characteristics and eludes that some of these structures, possibly all of these structures are related or even are the same phenomena \cite{Porfir2016A}. For example there has been a long standing question where spicules and mottles are the same. Dark mottles are seen on disk, where as the classic spicule is observed at the limb and they have similar properties \cite{Pontieu2007ASPC}. The formation of jets in the solar chromosphere is one of the most important, but also most poorly understood phenomena of the Sun's magnetized outer atmosphere \citep{Hansteen2006ApJ}. \np

\subsection{Spicules}
\label{subsec:Spicules}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% better here 
Spicules are thin plasma flows that are omnipresent on the surface of the Sun with approximately $2 \times 10^{7}$ Ca II spicules on the the Sun at any time \citep{Judge_2010ApJ}. Spicules are best observed in strong chromospheric and transition region (TR) lines such as H$\alpha$, Ca II H \& K, Mg II H \& K, C II and Si IV lines. They first observed by \cite{Secchi1877} and where given their name by \cite{Roberts1945ApJ} who stated ``I was amazed at the extremely brief lifetimes and the great frequency of occurrence which visual observations of these spicules indicated". The life time they reported ranged from approximately 2-11 minutes which fits in the range of current estimates for spicules life times. These short life times along with temporal and spatial resolution limits made observing individual spicules historically difficult \citep{Sterling_2000SoPh}. In addition the dynamic nature of the spicules' poses a challenge as they are typically mobbed by other spicules shielding one another, they have bi-directional flows, kinking, twisting, and torsion motions. Other effects such as distortions due to the projection effect and spicule inclination add even more complexity as these effects can give an unreal and misleading picture of spicule dimension and behavior \citep{Porfir2016A}. \np
%
Despite these challenges in observations much effort has been as there is substantial amount of observational data on spicules available, giving us an understanding of their basic properties (mass density, temperature, velocity and magnetic field) \citep[see reviews:][]{Beckers1968, Beckers1972ARA&A}, possible driving mechanisms \citep[see review:][]{Sterling_2000SoPh}, and the waves and oscillations spicules can host \citep[see review:][]{Zaqarashvili_2009SSRv}. The main interest that lies in spicules is the potential to solve outstanding problems in solar physics, such as providing mass and energy into the solar atmosphere and wind, heating chromosphere/corona, and driving the solar wind {\color{green} !!cite ahoy!!}. The mass flux taken by the spicule to the corona exceeds that of the solar wind by two orders of magnitude \citep{Thomas1961} and spicules on average carry (!find amount!) of energy, if even (!find! \%) of spicule energy is dumped into the corona then it could easily power the upper atmosphere \citep{Woltjer1954BAN,Rush1954AuJPh,Li2009RAA} (!not correct papers to cite!). Another important factor, due to their ubiquity it is imperative that we can accurately model and describe spicules for us to understand the Sun's chromosphere. With the combination of improved spatial and temporal resolution achieved with telescopes, such as Hinode \citep{Tsuneta2008SoPh,Suematsu2008SoPh,Ichimoto2008SoPh}, TRACE, IRIS and SST \citep{Scharmer2003SPIE}, over the last two decades, and improved computational models have led to a "renaissance" in spicule research \citep{Aschwanden2019ASSL}. A major factor in this renewed interest was the discovery that the spicules contain two distinct types, labeled as Type I (TI) and Type II (TII) spicules by \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}. \np
% Might be better in coclusion
{\color{green} might be better in conclusion} We are at the beginning of the next generation of solar telescopes with $4$ m European Solar Telescope with first light planned in $2026$ \citep{Matthews2016SPIE} and $4$ m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) which released the highest resolution in image of Sun's surface and allowed us to see features as small as $30$ km and will allow the study of spicules in unprecedented detail.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Type I}
\label{subsec:TI}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jets observed at the QS limb are traditionally called spicules, they are observed as bright ``straws", typically grouped together with other spicules and are located across the boundaries of supergranular cells. This group behavior was first described as “porcupine” and “wheat” field patterns by \cite{Lippincott1957SCoA215L}. They are typically observed in H$\alpha$ as thin, finger-like features, that rapidly elongate upwards with an average velocity of $\sim 25$ km s$^{-1}$ and reaches its apex within 1-2 minutes after it initial appearance and then fall back to the low chromosphere with a similar velocity its starting ascent \citep{Tsiropoula2012}. Spicules have always been an important feature to study since their discovery over 140 years ago. They are ubiquitous on the sun and dominate feature in some chromospheric filtergrams e.g. Ca II H \cite{Pereira2016ApJ82465P}. Because of their vast numbers they are a key observational window for the investigations related to the dynamics of the chromosphere and the mass and energy transfer mechanism across the solar the atmosphere. Early calculations showed it was theoretically possible for spicules to drive the solar wind as they their mass flux can be 100 times greater than the solar wind, thus if even if a majority of of the flux comes back down only a few percent is needed to continue upwards \cite{Pneuman1978SoPh5749P,Pneuman1977AA55305P}. They are also good candidates for supplying mass and energy to heat the corona (!find refs!). \\
\par The type I spicules where first defined by \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ} using data from Ca II from Hinode/SOT. They are similar to the traditional limb spicule and are defined as long lived structures with life times of $\sim 180-420$ s, which have bidirectional up flows of mass (rise up from the limb and then fall) following a parabolic path and have upward velocity of the order of $20$ km s$^{-1}$. These spicules are proposed to be initiated by by \textit{p}-mode leakage between granular cells \citep{Pontieu2004Natur}. Most studies report that a spicules lifetime is between $120-720$ s with an average $\sim 300$ s \cite{Georgakilas1999AA341610G,Cook1984AdSpR459C,Alissandrakis1971SoPh2047A,Lippincott1957SCoA215L,Rush1954AuJPh7230R,Roberts1945ApJ}.  
More recently, \cite{Pasachoff2009SoPh26059P} found lifetimes between $180$ and $720$ s who studied the spicules in H$\alpha$, with a mean value of $426\pm138$ s. These lifetimes reasonably agree with \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ} measurements. \cite{Pereira2012} measured lifetime between $150-400$ s. The heights of spicules are typically measured from its foot in the photospheric limb up to where spicule becomes no longer visible. However, measuring the heights of spicules can be tricky as its roots based in photosphere can be difficult to identify due to their grouping behavior, its not obvious whether the footpoint is in front or behind the limb is  and the top of spicule doesn't have clear defined boundary. Other observational factors add to this difficulty such as, exposure time and seeing conditions. Spicules have historically been mostly observed in the H$\alpha$ line which is difficult to trace down due the opacity of chromosphere. Despite these difficulties there is general agreement on reported spicules heights \cite{Tsiropoula2012}. Using data from H$\alpha$ observations \cite{Beckers1972ARA&A,Beckers1968} estimated the average heights between $6.5$-$9.5$ Mm. \cite{Pasachoff2009SoPh26059P} used both H$\alpha$ observations and combined with TRACE data in the 16000 \AA channel to obtain heights in the range $4.2-12.2$ Mm with a mean $7.2\pm2$ Mm. \cite{Pasachoff2009SoPh26059P} observed heights in TRACE UV found them be $\sim 2.8$ Mm taller than in H$\alpha$. \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ} measure heights in Ca II H using Hinode/SOT which vary from few hundred km to $10$ Mm with most below $5$ Mm. \cite{Pereira2012} report maximum heights of $4-8$ $Mm$ using Ca II H data from Hinode/SOT. In the past spicules widths ($200-1,000$ km) and dynamics have, been very close to the resolution limits of observations \citep{Pontieu2007ASPC}. As a result of this limitation, the superposition inherent in limb observations, and the difficulty of interpreting H${\alpha}$, the properties of spicules have not been well constrained, which have led to many theoretical models. There is an agreement on widths measured in spicule. \cite{Beckers1972ARA&A,Beckers1968} used H$\alpha$ and Ca II H and K line observation reporting widths between $400-2,500$ km, with most spicules having diameter between  400 and 1,500 km \cite{Lynch1973SoPh3063L,Dunn1960Obs8031D}. \cite{Pasachoff2009SoPh26059P} reported observing in H$\alpha$ with SST gave widths of $300-1,100$ km with mean diameter of $660$ km and found just as with heights, widths are also greater by a factor of 1.5 with ranges of $700-2,500$ km when using measuring with 1600 \AA TRACE data. The discrepancy in widths could TRACE resolution is approximately four times lower than SST and highlight the impact resolutions can have on these measurements. \cite{Tavabi2011NewA16296T} measured widths in Ca II H using SOT/Hinode and reported a range of widths from $200$ km to more than $1,000$ km. \cite{Pereira2012} measured width of $\sim 220-420$ km. For limb spicule velocities \cite{Pasachoff2009SoPh26059P} measured ascending velocities with a mean of $27\pm18.1$ km s$^{-1}$, a median of $25$ km s$^{-1}$ and a range of $3-75$ km s$^{-1}$. \cite{Pereira2012} measured ascending velocities of $15-40$ km s$^{-1}$. Spicules appear at different angles of inclination that range from approximately $20^{\circ}$ \cite{Beckers1968} to $37^{\circ}$ \cite{Trujillo2005ApJ619L191T} with an average of $23^{\circ}$. \cite{Pereira2012} measured inclinations of $\sim 5^{\circ}-25^{\circ}$.   
To summarise above the typical properties of limb spicules are they have heights of $7-13$ Mm, widths of $300-1500$ km, during their lifetimes of $1-10$ minutes, an upward velocity of $25$ km s$^{-1}$, temperatures ranging from $5,000-15,000$ K and densities of approximately $3\times10^{-13}$ g cm$^{-3}$ \citep{Sterling_2000SoPh}.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Type II}
\label{subsec:TII}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Type-II spicule rise linearly and is faster ($30-110$ km s$^{-1}$) and shorter lived ($50-150$ s) in comparison to Type-I spicule. Type II spicules form rapidly ($\sim 10$ s), are very thin ($\leq 200$ km wide) and seem to be rapidly heated to atleast TR temperatures, sending material through the chromosphere. Because of these properties it is hypothesised they are driven by magnetic reconnection,  typically in areas of magnetic flux concentrations in plages and networks as it is capable of accelerating plasma at to or close to the \Alfven speed over a short period of time \citep{Pontieu2007PASJ}. When observing Type II spicules in Ca II passband they appear to rise linearly until their maximum length, and then dissipate quickly over their whole length, suggesting that they are heated out of the Ca II passband \citep{Pereira2012}. When study in other wave length with AIA the invisible part of the spicule in Ca II can be tracked and downflow of the material can be observed (check the precisely). The existence of the spicules classification was called into question by \cite{Zhang2012ApJ} who revisited the same data as \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}. They studied $10^5$ jets in QS and $10^2$ in CH and reported ``we have note found a single convincing example of ``Type II" spicule". They argue that using a fixed slit to obtain time distance plots are an inaccurate way of tracking spicule evolution as any lateral motions in the spicule (i.e. spicules direction won't necessarily be in a fixed direction and along the slit) will affect the lifetimes and heights measured. Instead they decided to use filtergram data as it better captures 3D motions of spicules. This is highlighted Fig.1 in the rightmost panel in example C in \cite{Zhang2012ApJ} as we can triangle marker (point selected for the space–time diagrams) misses the top of the spicule as its fixed in the horizontal direction, however if the filtergram is used then "true" height of the spicule is captured marked by a cross. Comparing the kinematic parameter found in each study \cite{Zhang2012ApJ} shows that \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ} under estimates spicules heights and lifetimes. They show that greater than 60\% of the spicules move in a complete cycle of ascent and descent in QS and CH show complete cycle of upward and downward motion motions and they conclude that Type I spicules dominate and no convincing Type II spicule has been observed. However, a later study by \cite{Pereira2012} looked again into the same data reach similar conclusion as \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}, in that there are two distinct types of spicules. They used a semi-automated procedure that traces out individual spicules accounting for their transverse motion, thus giving a more accurate results than \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}. They found only upward motion demonstrated by roughly 9\% in QS and roughly 24\% in CHs. Other cases show only descending or were uncertain. They then use this fitted line on the spicule to construct time distance plots to determine whether the spicule evolves linear or parabolic fashion. They label these spicules into two categories, either parabola (spicules that rise and fall) or linear spicule (spicules that raise and fade out of Ca II H line). They report that by looking at the distributions of the properties for parabola (lifetime $3-7$ mins, velocities $15-40$ km s$^{-1}$, parabolic motion up and down) and linear spicules (lifetime $10-150$ s, velocities $50-150$ km s$^{-1}$, motion up only) their is clearly two very different populations of spicules. Not only do they recover the spicules types in \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}, the Type II spicules is the most commonly observed which is in complete disagreement with \cite{Zhang2012ApJ}. They further more highlight that in \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ} they specifically excluded spicules with transverse motions, and thus \cite{Zhang2012ApJ} criticisms of the space-time diagrams does not hold. \\          
\par In \cite{Pereira2014ApJ} they reported the first spicule observation with IRIS which added more evidence to the existence of type II spicules. they find that the Type II spicule show parabolic space-time diagram in the IRIS and AIA filters. Although this contradicts there earlier classification of type II spicule i.e. linear spicule, there are clearly 2 types as there defining properties fall into two distinct groups. Determining the existence of type II spicules is important because they have a larger potential to transfer energy and mass from the photosphere to the chromosphere and corona \citep{Pereira2012}. As it has been previously thought that spicules could not contribute to coronal heating due to a lack of a a coronal counterpart \citep{Withbroe1983ApJ}. In \cite{DePontieu2009}. They suggest that Type II spicule is the coronal counterpart and that can play a vital role in energy and mass transfer into the corona. \\
\par With type II spicules we don't observe a falling phase, which suggest that they are being heated out of the Ca II H passband, and are the initial cool phase of spicules that are heated into TR and coronal temperatures. In \cite{Pontieu2011Sci} they report a coronal counterpart of type II spicule directly in imaging, showing how some spicules evolve from Ca II H images into higher temperatures passbands in AIA, showing their potential in heating the corona.

\subsubsection{Macrospicule}
\label{subsec:Mspic}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macrospicules as their there name suggest are they are spicule-like features and just like with all spicular features their importance of investigation is linked to the potential to help resolve what is the source of the solar wind generation and how the corona is heated and maintained. How do these features different from the classic H$\alpha$ spicule? Macroispicules extend further into the solar atmosphere, they are longer lived, classic spicules can be seen everywhere in chromosphere, but macrospicules are sparsely seen and are typically visible in in TR lines e.g. He II 304 \AA, N IV 765 \AA and O V 630 \AA, formed at temperatures approximately $8\times10^4$, $1.4\times10^5$ and $2.5\times10^5$ K, respectively. Macrospicules have proved a challenge to identify as they are similar to other large jet-like phenomena and due to their properties having large ranges, which in turn makes modeling them troublesome and understanding how they contributed to puzzle of mass transfer and energy balance in the solar atmosphere. The macrospicules where first defined around 45 years ago when \cite{Bohlin1975ApJ197L133B} described these features at polar coronal holes using SkyLab's NRL extreme-ultraviolet slitless spectrograph in the He II 304 \AA  line. They found Macrospicules to be visible in He II 304 \AA, but not in Ne VII 465 \AA (TR line) or Mg IX 368 \AA (coronal line) and outlined three observational criteria for identification of a macrospicule:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Confined to coronal holes.
\item Increasingly inclined away from the pole as a function of increasing position angle measured from the pole.
\item Only visible in 304 \AA. 
\end{enumerate}
Following this criteria they identified 25 macrospicules with lengths of $8\arcsec - 25\arcsec$ with a lifetime of around $8-45$ minutes. They argue that there is no H$\alpha$ macrospicule counterpart observed as \cite{Moe1975SoPh4065K}, where unable to find any correlation either by direct visual inspection or by numerical correlation of the measured position of the spicules in the two wavelengths. Due to limitations of the observations at the time, there was much debate as to whether this was actually the case. \cite{Labonte1979SoPh61283L} use the Big Bear solar Observatory to examined  $32$ of the ``limb surges'' with the H$\alpha$ and D$_3$ filters. They found macrospicules exhibited complex structures with ``knots, twists and loops'' with lengths of $8\arcsec-33\arcsec$ and lifetimes of $4-24$ minutes. For the H$\alpha$ macrospicules heights range from $\sim 6-24$ Mm with the majority around $\sim 10-16$ Mm, widths ranging from $0.5-4\times 10^3$ km with a peak around $1-2\times 10^3$ km and lifetimes ranging from $\sim 4-24$ minutes with most around $\sim 8-12$ minutes. This study challenges the criteria (3) of macrospicule set out by \cite{Bohlin1975ApJ197L133B}. \cite{Labonte1979SoPh61283L} identified three categories of macrospicules: (I) similar to filament eruptions, (II) surge-like macrospicules and (III) a flare brightening type. The next step in understanding macrospicule came with the SOHO observations as this allowed astronomers to study solar features with multi-lined/multi-thermal and with higher temporal and spatial resolution, all of which are key ingredients for jet diagnostics. \cite{Pike1997SoPh175457P} used the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer on this space base telescope to observe in He I 584 \AA, O V 630 \AA and Mg IX 368 \AA lines and gave a case study of a single macrospicule. They find that macrospicule are visible in He and O V lines, but in the Mg line, this tell us that they reach TR, but not coronal temperatures. These measured the macrospicule length at 31 Mm, width 13.3 Mm and proposed that EUV macrospicules and X-ray jets are a manifestation of the same underlying physical phenomena, which could be the source of the fast solar wind as well. In a follow up study \cite{Pike1998SoPh182333P} used the same instrument to identify the rotational properties of macrospicules. They observed blueshifted and redshifted emission opposites sides to one another of the jet axis above the limb, which suggests rational motion. These rotational veracities increase with height and these macrospicules where categorised as ``solar tornadoes''. \cite{Parenti2002AA384303P} using the same instrument found macrospicules extend to $60$ Mm reaching maximum velocity of $\sim 80$ km s$^{-1}$, average falling speed of 26 km s$^{-1}$, they estimated the temperature around $2\times10^5$ K and density of $10^{-10}$ cm$^{-3}$. \\ \\
\par So far all the studies stated have based their macrospicule parameters on small groups, some are even on a singular event. While these studies still hold value, its doesn't give a strong statistical representation of the behavior of these features. In more recent studies \cite{Bennett2015ApJ808135B,Kiss2017ApJ83547K,Loboda2019ApJ871230L} all leverage the data that SDO/AIA has gathered over its years of operation with a data base $101$, 
$301$ and $330$ of macrospicules, respectively. They also show along with \cite{Wang1998ApJ509461W} that macrospicules are seen in different regions of magnetic environments although the are less numerous e.g. QS, shows that criteria ($1$) in incorrect. \cite{Bennett2015ApJ808135B} examined data collect over a 2.5 year time span. Of the 101 macrospicules they were located in different regions of the sun with $30.5\%$ in polar CH, $20\%$ at CH boundaries and $49.5\%$ in QS regoins. They give the general properties as maximum length range $\sim 14-60$ Mm with a mean of $28.1$ Mm, width with a range of $3.1-16.1$ Mm with a mean of $7.6$ Mm, lifetime with a range of $2.7-28$ minutes with a mean of $13.6$ minutes and maximum velocity ranging from $54-105$ km s$^{-1}$ with a mean of $109.7$ km s$^{-1}$. In this data set they only consider only consider jets 145 Mm, fell back on the solar surface and whose foot points were located exactly on the solar limb. In \cite{Kiss2017ApJ83547K} they look over a larger timespan of 5.5 years to gather their sample size of 301. They conclude that for macrospicules the lifetime is $16.75\pm4.5$, minutes, they have a width of $6.1\pm4$ Mm, an average velocity of $73.14\pm25.92$ km s$^{-1}$ and a length $28.05\pm7.67$ Mm. They define Mspics as ``thin'' jet phenomena shorter than $70$ Mm, with a visible connection to the solar surface and proceeded by brighting at the base. One caveat of both \cite{Kiss2017ApJ83547K,Bennett2015ApJ808135B} is their assumptions that define what a macrospicule is, meaning their database may not be inclusive of all types of a macrospicules, but a valid representation of a subset population. \cite{Loboda2019ApJ871230L} used 5 years worth of SDO/AIA data to obtain a sample of 330 with $63.3\%$ found in CH and $36.7\%$ in QS regions. They find significantly higher proportion of their macrospicules in CH than in \cite{Bennett2015ApJ808135B}. they find typical lengths of $16-32$ Mm, widths of $3-6$ Mm, typical lifetime 15 with a range of $13-18$ minutes, with velocities of $100$ km s$^{-1}$ with a range of initial velocities of $70-140$ km s$^{-1}$. They focus on these jets that undergo parabolic trajectories. \\ \\
\par To summarise a series of studies have detailed the properties of macrospicules. In general they show that macrospicules range in heights from $7- 70$ Mm, widths of $3-16$ Mm, maximum velocities of $10-150$ km s$^{-1}$ and  lifetimes $3-45$ minutes  \cite{Loboda2019ApJ871230L,Kiss2017ApJ83547K,Bennett2015ApJ808135B,Parenti2002AA384303P,Karovska1994ApJ,Dere1989SoPh,Withbroe1976ApJ,Bohlin1975ApJ197L133B}. Their widths and heights put them among the smallest categories of jets observed in the EUV. Their rising velcoities and lifetimes make them plausible candidates for being the EUV counterpart of type II spciules. As with much of the jet discussed here they have been observed to have parabolic paths that are non-ballistic. Curiously, just like with mottles and dynamic fibrils, there is a correlation between the initial velocities and declarations of the jet, which indicates that macrospicules are shock may be driven by magnetoacoustic shocks, but unlike mottles and dynamic fibrils ($1-2$ minutes for chromospheric jets), the shock would require a longer period of $10\pm 2$ minutes \cite{Loboda2019ApJ871230L}. This ultimately suggests that there macrospicule have a different set of formation conditions than chromospheric cousins.

\subsection{Mottles}
\label{subsec:mots}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The importance of understanding mottles is that the mass and energy flow represented is a critical factor to the overall mass and energy balance of the chromosphere and corona. Mottles are rapid changing ``hair-like" short jets observed on disk in the QS regions. They are organised in a complex geometric pattern over the solar disk following the boundaries of the chromospheric network which is more prominent in the Ca lines \citep{Tsiropoula2012}. They observed on disc in, usually in H$\alpha$ or the CaII lines. Mottles typically cluster together into two groups \citep{Beckers1963ApJ138648B}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chains: small group of mottles which extrude between the boundary of supergranular cells. The mottles are oriented in same direction and when observed near the limb, they emanate outwards in the same direction forming what \cite{Cragg1963ApJ138303C} called bushes. 
\item Rosettes: larger group of mottles in a circular collection, which are stretching out radially around an common center, like the stems of a drooping bouquet of flowers. They form around the common boundary area of three or more supergranular cells and have a central bright core and are surrounded by both dark and bright mottles \cite{Tsiropoula2012}.    
\end{enumerate} 
The combination of (1) and (2) form a chromosphere network. Mottles appear both dark and bright, where bright mottles are located at a lower height than dark mottles. They both occur at in the same regions of the solar chromosphere and histrionically it has been undetermined whether these are the same feature just observed at different heights or if they are separate features altogether  \citep{Tsiropoula2012, Tsiropoula1993A}. It has both been claimed that they are separate features \cite{Alissandrakis1971SoPh2047A} and that they are the same feature where a bright mottle may be the root of the elongated dark mottle \citep{Banos1970SoPh12106B}. Thanks to higher resolution observation of instruments such as SOUP, CRISP, IBIS and ROSA, it is possible to to identify fine structures in these mottles, and it is now thought that these bright mottles are the bright background below dark mottles \citep{Tsiropoula2012}. It's very important to observes these features at high resolution as features (1) and (2) are a complex sea of structures, one would not able resolve individual strands of the mottles. \\
% this section is going to be thier properties
\par The main properties of mottles are they have heights are roughly 2-10 Mm and have lifetimes of 2-15 minutes which is similar spicules  \citep{Suematsu1995ApJ}. They seem to be generated several hundred kilometers above the photosphere and undergo real mass motions of 10-30 km s$^{-1}$. Mottles are very dynamic structures that can vary in appearance as they curved, straight, thin, thick and have transverse motions \citep{De_Pontieu2007ApJ}. Most mottles have an ascending and descending phase which follow a parabolic trajectory. The largest Doppler signal appears at the beginning of the ascending phase and at the end of the descending phase. The velocity profiles of mottles are symmetrical around zero. The deceleration seen in mottles are too small to be purely because of solar gravity (i.e. they don't display perfect ballistic flight). \cite{Rouppe2007ApJ660L169R} found that there is a linear correlation between deceleration and maximum velocity of QS dark mottles and this relation has been observed in dynamic fibrils. They propose that these jets are driven with the same mechanism which is by single slow-mode magnetodynamics shock and this view point is further evidenced by numerical simulations e.g. \citep{De_Pontieu2007ApJ, Hansteen2006ApJ}. Surrounding mottles are often found to be driven by a common disturbance \cite{De_Pontieu2007ApJ}.
%this section is relating them to limb spicules    
\par Another standing question is whether spicules are observed against disk in of H$\alpha$ as dark or bright mottles \citep{Tsiropoula1993A}. There observational inconsistency between interpreting spicules and mottles as counterparts. One main issue is that the velocity in spicules is much greater than (calculated from proper motions) is much greater than those measured in mottles (derived from spectroscopic observations) \cite{Grossmann1992AA264236G, Christopoulou2001SoPh19961C}. The discrepancy in the velocities is large with up to an order of magnitude difference being reported in \cite{Grossmann1973SoPh28319G}. They both exhibit different velocity distributions, where mottles are symmetric around zero, which means there is as much matter flowing upwards as downwards. Whereas, spicules velocity distributions are asymmetric and  are mainly seen as rising. These differences in the observations can not be attributed to the angular distributions of spicules and mottles \cite{Grossmann1992AA264236G} and has lead researchers to believe that mottles and spicules are separate features \cite{Christopoulou2001SoPh19961C}. \cite{Christopoulou2001SoPh19961C} propose two possible reasons for this discrepancy, (I) the fact that the values derived from spectroscopic observations represents averages of $1-2\arcsec$. Therefore, as the matter moves with greater velocities it is confined to structures below this resolution limit, then velocity signal is affected by seeing (!this is from an old paper, may not be valid as we have better resolution!). (II) For high velocity spicules they are near vertical, high altitude structures that occur amidst a sea of mottles that have low velocity that are highly inclined structures. Therefore, due to geometrical effect when observing at the limb spicules will dominate, whereas on disk the mottles would dominate \citep{Grossmann1992AA264236G}. When linking spicules and mottles there are two Avenue to consider, indirect and direct observational evidence. The indirect evidence that supports this link are: dark mottles and spicules have their optimum visibility at the same wavelength in the wings of H$\alpha$ \citep{Tsiropoula1993A}, follow a parabolic trajectory akin to type I spicules \cite{Rouppe2007ApJ660L169R} and they have similar important physical properties such as lifetime and height. The most convincing observational evidence would be to track a spicule or mottle journey as it crosses the solar limb. This is challenging as when tracing the spicules back on disk, one does not know on what side of the limb the feature you are observing is located, and its expected most spicules will have their roots close to the solar limb so that they would not transform into a clearly identified disk structure \cite{Beckers1968}. \cite{Christopoulou2001SoPh19961C} found multiple examples of individual mottles crossing the solar limb and gives more support to the link between mottles and spicules. In light of the observational evidence both indirect and direct, one can reasonably conclude that spicules and mottles are counterpart to one another.

\subsection{RREs/RBEs}
\label{subsec:rbe}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid redshifted and blueshifted excursions (RRE and RBEs) are short-lived and rapidly moving absorption features in the strong chromospheric H$\alpha$ and Ca II spectral lines. They appear as sudden shifts in the Doppler estimates at the wing-position of the line of the profile. They are located at the edges of rosettes where there are no dominating shocks compared the network and internetwork. RBEs were first reported by \cite{Langangen2008ApJ}, while searching for on disk counterparts of type II spicules. They reported lengths in the range of $0.5-1.5$ Mm with average $1.2$ Mm, widths in range of $300-600$ km with average of $500$ km. They showed these are short lived features with lifetimes of $45\pm13$ s and have velocities of order $15-20$ km s$^{-1}$.\cite{Rouppe2009ApJ} studied RBEs in Ca II and H$\alpha$ data using CRISP instrument at SST. They reported similar properties with lengths of $\sim 3$ Mm, lifetimes of $\sim 45$ s and Doppler velocities $\sim 20$ km s$^{-1}$. \cite{Sekse2013ApJ76944S,Sekse2013ApJ764164S} investigates RREs in the red wing of the  Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines, finding average length $\sim 3$ Mm with widths of $\sim 250$ km and Doppler velocities of $\sim 15-20$ km s$^{-1}$, are similar to those found with RBEs.  In more recent by \cite{Kuridze2015ApJ80226K} they showed that RREs and RBEs have near identical lifetimes, widths and lengths. they reported that both have lifetimes have a range of $\sim 20-120$, with a majority living around $40$ s, length have a range of $2-9$ Mm with typical value of $\sim 3$ Mm, widths with a range of $200-500$ km with majority around $250$ km and found velocities estimated in the range of $50-150$ km s$^{-1}$, which is \Alfvenic and super \Alfvenic in the chromosphere. \\
\par Finding an on disk counterpart to type II spicules is important as it gives alternative path to explore to solve outstanding problems present by these jets. Having a top view of these feature means we will have a view that in not effected by line of sight superposition issue that occurs at the limb. These RBEs give an insight into the possible mechanism for jet formation. Are RBEs and type II spicules counterparts to one another? In \cite{Langangen2008ApJ} the length of RBE is shorter than type II spicule, but this could be caused by intrinsic difference in the visibility. The magnitude of the mass motion in RBEs is lower than the apparent motion observed in type II spicules. It is thought the driver for type II spicules is due to magnetic reconnection. If this reconnection is taken place at different heights in the atmosphere and if the amount of energy is similar for each event, then we would expect the density and velocity of the jet to be dependent on height; i.e. (1) lower heights would give high density jet with low velocity and (2) higher heights give low density jet with high velocity. This inverse relationship between density and velocity nicely accounts for the discrepancy between on disk mass motion and the limb apparent motion. For situation (1) this would show enough absorption to be visible on disk, but would missed on limb observations due to the fibrilar mess at lower heights. For scenario (2) these events on disk would be difficult to observed due them having low opacity, but on limb they rise past the mess of the lower chromosphere and be clearly visible. This mean that difference seen in mass motion could be due to observation biases that are dependent on the locales the jet. \cite{Langangen2008ApJ} suggests that Ca II RBEs are linked to Hinode Ca II H spicules observed at limb \cite{Pontieu2007PASJ}. This reasoning is based on the matching physical properties such as, lifetimes, location near network, fading, spatial extent and that they only show blueshift which corresponds to upward motion. \cite{Rouppe2009ApJ} adds more fuel to the fire by reporting more similarities of lifetimes, locations, temporal evolution, velocities, acceleration, occurrence rate, between RBEs and type II spicules. In addition, they report that RBEs undergo significant transverse motions ($\sim 8$ km s$^-1$) during their life, similar to whats observed in type II spicules ($\sim 12$ km s$^{-1}$) \cite{De_Pontieu2007}. Overall these parameter of RBEs that have been reported agree well with what is observed in type II spicules on the limb. \\                  
%-------------
\par In \cite{Langangen2008ApJ} they used the IBIS instrument on DST (Dunn Solar Telescope) to search for the disk counter part of type II spicules and identified RBE's as a potential candidate. Although they found RBEs have have a similar life time, they appeared to have shorter lengths and lower mass motions speeds. This discrepancy in length is reported being due to line-of-sight effects (i.e. caused by the intrinsic difference in visibility between the on disk and limb observations). Further observations of RBE's have been made using the spectral imaging data in Ca II 854.2 nm and H$\alpha$ lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter at SST which observed Doppler shifts in the range of $20-50$ km s$^{-1}$. With this instrument they observed average life time of $83.9$ s average lifetimes, apparent velocities of order $50$ km s$^{-1}$ and that RBE's experience significant transverse motion of the order $5-10$ km s$^{-1}$ \citep{Rouppe2009ApJ,Sekse2012ApJ}. These parameters agree well with what is observed in type II spicules on the limb.

\subsection{Fibrils and Dynamic Filbrils}
\label{subsec:dfibs}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%what are they and where and how are they seen
Fibrils are the chromospheric equivalence of coronal loops as they appears as curvilinear structure, that follow the local magnetic field and are dynamic structures with flows, oscillations and waves \cite{Aschwanden2019ASSL}. The main difference from coronal loop is the typical temperatures of fibrils are $\gtrsim 5000$ K and these structures are partially ionized gas, whereas coronal loops have temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^6$ K and are a fully ionized plasma. These features are observed in in close proximity of sunspots (penumbral-fibrils) and are closely linked with the low-lying loops that don't display jet-like behavior. \cite{Beckers1968} reported the life times 3-15 minutes and reach heights $5-9$Mm \\
\par A feature that does display jet-like behavior are the dynamic fibrils \citep{De_Pontieu2007ApJ,Hansteen2006ApJ}. These are thin tube-like, elongated and that are highly dynamic and are observed near regions with high magnetic field concentrations (AR/plages). \cite{Foukal1971SoPh1959F,Foukal1971SoPh20298F} proposed that their is a relationship between the thin flux-tube structures seen near AR and those is QS environment. They showed that all these features have similar physical parameter, e.g. length, lifetimes, velocities, density and the temperatures, for the fibril and spicular phenomena. The fibrils they observed appeared to be much more elongated than spicules and mottles and due to the strong magnetic field, they are more inclined to the vertical and appear horizontal when observed on disk. When dynamic fibrils are observed in H$\alpha$ and Ca II wavelengths, these structures show close resemblance to the mottles in the QS regions, in terms of appearance in clusters as bushes or rosettes.    \cite{De_Pontieu2007ApJ} reported on their observations using SST of dynamic fibrils in H$\alpha$, they found average length $1.25$ Mm with a ranges varying from ($0.4-5.2$Mm) with lifetimes of $120-650$ s and average widths of $340$km, similar to widths are reported in \cite{Morton2012NatCo31315M} and \cite{Gafeira2017ApJS2297G}, $360\pm120$ km and $\tilde{260}$, respectively. They ascend with typical velocity of $10-30$ km s$^-1$ and follow a parabolic path as they rise and fall. The observed deceleration is found to be only a fraction of solar gravity and therefore, doesn't follow a purely ballistic path expected due to solar gravity. This  is expected if it is driven with chromospheric shock waves that occur when convective flows and p-modes leak into the chromosphere \citep{Langangen2008ApJ6731194L,De_Pontieu2007ApJ}.        
\par Due to more reliable observations of these jet structures, thanks to developments in observational techniques, such as bigger telescopes combined with real-time wave front corrections by adaptive optics (AO) systems e.g. \citep{Scharmer2003SPIE4853370S,Rimmele2000SPIE4007218R} and postprocessing methods e.g. \citep{van2005SoPh228191V,von1993AA268374V}, it has been possible to study how dynamics fibrils form. Through a combination of observational data from SST and numerical experiment using the Bifrost 3D Radiative, \cite{Hansteen2006ApJ} showed that that jets in AR are a natural consequence of upwardly propagating slow-mode magneto-acoustic shocks, generated by convective flows and p-mode oscillations in the lower photosphere, and leaking upward into the magnetized chromosphere along inclined flux tubes. This view point is also supported in other works e.g. \citep{Heggland2007ApJ6661277H,De_Pontieu2007ApJ,Pontieu2004Natur,Suematsu1990LNP367211S}, and this driving mechanism for fibrils is akin to mottles. Given that the dynamic fibril physical properties, dynamics, morphology and driver are all similar to mottles, this strongly suggest that they are similar phenomenon, only located in regions of different magnetic activity and that dynamics fibrils are AR counterparts to QS mottles \citep{Rouppe2007ApJ660L169R}.

\subsection{Basic Structure of Super Sonic jets}
\label{struc_of_jets}
%------------------------
{\color{green} need to move elsewhere}
A schematic diagram of basic structure of a jet is given by \fref{ssj}. When a HD super sonic jet moves through the ambient medium, a bow shock is formed is formed in front of the advancing head of the jet and at the top of jet itself there is a Mach disk which is usually much stronger than the bow shock \citep{Chakrabarti1988}. The region close to advancing head of the jet is referred as working surface of the jet. Between the bow shock and the jet there are two other distinct regions the cocoon and screen which are separated by a contact discontinuity. The cocoon is the shocked jet medium and screen is the shocked ambient medium. The velocity of the jet head $v_h$ by comparing the momentum fluxes the jet and the external matter at the head of the jet and is estimated by the following,
%\begin{equation}\label{v_j_speed}
%v_h \approx \dfrac{v_j}{1+ \left( \dfrac{\rho_e}{\rho_j} \right)^{\sfrac{1}{2}}} 
%\end{equation}
From \eref{v_j_speed} we can see for light jets ($\eta_j<1$) this means that speed of the head of the jet will be slower than the jet speed itself, this leads to a pile up of material which forms the cocoon. For heavy jets ($\eta_j>1$), the head of the jet will advance with speeds comparable to the jet itself and thus leads to much less back flow. This is why there is very little back flow 
%----------------
% I may not include this
%\par !probably wont include in paper! 
When describing a jets these parameters are key for defining its morphology and structure: $v_j$, $\eta_j = \frac{\rho_j}{\rho_a}$, $K = \frac{p_{d}}{p_a}$, where $\rho_a(p_a)$ is the ambient density(pressure) and $p_{d}$ is the pressure at the driver. $\eta_j$ measures the density contrast of the jet itself and the ambient medium it propagates through. If $\eta_j>1(\eta_j<1)$ then a jet is labeled to as heavy(light). For $K$ with denotes our jet to ambient pressures ratio determine whether the jet is under-expanded ($K>1$) or over-expanded ($K<1$). In our case we are dealing with the expected dynamics of a heavy under expanded-jet. When a HD super sonic jet moves through the ambient medium, a bow shock is formed is formed in front of the advancing head of the jet and at the top of jet itself there is a Mach disk which is usually much stronger than the bow shock \citep{Chakrabarti1988}. The region close to advancing head of the jet is referred as working surface of the jet. Between the bow shock and the jet there are two other distinct regions the cocoon and screen which are separated by a contact discontinuity. The cocoon is the shocked jet medium and screen is the shocked ambient medium. The velocity of the jet head $v_h$ by comparing the momentum fluxes the jet and the external matter at the head of the jet and is estimated by the following,
\begin{equation}\label{v_j_speed}
v_h \approx \dfrac{v_j}{1+ \left( \dfrac{\rho_e}{\rho_j} \right)^{\sfrac{1}{2}}} 
\end{equation}
From \eref{v_j_speed} we can see for light jets ($\eta_j<1$) this means that speed of the head of the jet will be slower than the jet speed itself, this leads to a pile up of material which forms the cocoon. For heavy jets ($\eta_j>1$), the head of the jet will advance with speeds comparable to the jet itself and thus leads to much less back flow. This is why there is very little back flow in these jet. The bow shock can be seen early on in the simulation and we see that the temperature increase at the head of the jet (see left most panel in Fig. \eqref{paramter_scan_one}.

These magnetic fields support waves oscillations which can be studies to in the coronal environment such as coronal loops which allows us to determine properties such as density \citep{Verwichte_2013A_A}, magnetic field strength \citep{Nakariakov_2001} and temperature \citep{De_Moortel_2003SoPh}.

%\subsubsection{Numerical Techniques}
%Solving differential equations are key part of understanding the physics occurring in nature. Often coupled systems of differential equations can not be solved analytically without making major assumption to simply the equation and thus removing important physics from the original problem. A classic example of a system of equations which isn't solvable analytically is the three body problem where using Newtonian mechanics you consider three masses interacting with one another through gravitational force. The numerical soultions to this problem allowed the revolution in modern space flights, and the launch of the two Voyager probes. By using numerical techniques on the MHD equations we gain an insight into systems which are too complex to obtain analytically.  \\ \\A differential is the gradient of a function over an infinitesimally small range. The numerical approximation takes this range and makes it finite, calculation the differential from an approximation dependent on the selected method. In the sub-sections I will summarise a selection of solvers used in the MPI-AMRVAC code that are applied in this thesis.
%\subsubsection{Finite Difference Method}
%The general expression for a derivative is the following:
%\begin{equation}
%f'(x)=\lim\limits _{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} , 
%\end{equation}
%the finite difference method (FDM) approximates this equation by taking the step size $h$ as finite. The general form of a finite difference equation is $f(x+b)-f(x+a)$. The two simplest forms are:
%\begin{align}
%\Delta_+ f =  f(x+h)-f(x), \\
%\Delta_- f = f(x-h)-f(x) .
%\end{align}
%These equations can be used to calculate the derivatives by using the following:
%\begin{align}
%\text{Forward Difference: }&f'(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(h)}{h} , \\
%\text{Backwards Difference: }&f'(x) = \frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h}
%\end{align}
%These equations can be derived from a Taylor expansion of $f(x\pm h)$,
%\begin{align}
%f(x-h) & = f(x)-h f'(x)+\frac{h^{2}f''(x)}{2!}-\frac{h^{3}f'''(x)}{3!}+\frac{h^{4}f^{iv}(x)}{4!}+...\label{eq:TaylorForward}\\
%f(x+h) & = f(x)+h f'(x)+\frac{h^{2}f''(x)}{2!}+\frac{h^{3}f'''(x)}{3!}+\frac{h^{4}f^{iv}(x)}{4!}+...\label{eq:TaylorBackward}
%\end{align}
%The forward (backwards) difference equations is the first-order truncation of the $f(x+h)$ ($f(x+h)$) Taylor series. From this it can be seen that the truncation error of a forward and backward difference approximation is $O(h)$, and that the accuracy is easily improved by increasing the number of terms included. \\ \\
%Another variation of FDM that reduces the error, while maintaining the first-order nature of these solutions is achieved by combining the forward and backward difference into a central difference approximation of the following form: 
%\begin{equation}
%f(x)=\frac{1}{2} \left(f(x + h) + f(x - h)\right).
%\end{equation}
%Preforming a Taylor expansion and taking first order as previous done results in the following: 
%\begin{equation}
%f'(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}.\label{eq:First Order CD}
%\end{equation}
%The  error for central difference approximation $O(h^{2})$ as we have combined both the two Taylor series expansions. The accuracy of the solution is important, for it determines how well the computed solution represents the true solution. The most obvious way to increase the accuracy of the solution is to increase the number of terms included from the Taylor expansion of the forward and backward differences. For example the derivation of a fourth-order central difference scheme which can be calculated by starting from Eqs. \eqref{eq:TaylorForward}-\eqref{eq:TaylorBackward} and subtracting the second from the first, to the fourth order gives, in one dimension the following:
%\begin{equation}
%f(x+h)-f(x-h)=2 h f'(x)+\frac{2 h^{3} f'''(x)}{3!}+O(h^{4}).\label{eq:centraldifferencedx}
%\end{equation}
%The next step is to calculate the same subtraction for $2 h$ which can be written as:
%\begin{equation}
%f(x+2 h)-f(x-2 h)=4 h f'(x)+\frac{16 h^{3}f'''(x)}{3!}+O(h^{4}).\label{eq:CentralDifference2dx}
%\end{equation}
%Then subtracting \eqref{eq:CentralDifference2dx} from $8\times$(\eqref{eq:centraldifferencedx}) and rearranging for $f'(x)$ results in:
%\begin{equation}
%f'(x)=\frac{8f(x+h)-8f(x-h)-f(x+2h)+f(x-2h)}{12h}+O(h^{4}),\label{eq:4thOrderCentralDifferenceUniform}
%\end{equation}
%which is the fourth order central difference scheme in one dimension for a uniform spacing of $\pm h$.
%This scheme can be expanded into $n$ dimensions by using the basic property of differentiation $\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x\partial y}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)$. This scheme provides good accuracy while being computationally efficient.
%\subsubsection{TVLD}
%Need to add other solvers used in AMRVAC.
%\subsection{Atmospheric Model}
%%Need to add images background for models. 
%SP2RC has a method for constructing 3D MHD equilibrium for multiple magnetic flux tubes in a stratified solar atmosphere \citep{Gent_2013p1,Gent_2014p2}. This solar atmospheric model incorporates a wide and realistic range of scales using the combined results of \cite{Vernazza_1981ApJS}  VALIIIC model for the chromosphere and \cite{McWhirter1975} for the lower corona. This model can then used in Sheffield Advance Code \citep{Griffiths2013} which splits the equation in terms of its steady state for the background, then governing equations can be reduced, solving only the evolution for the perturbations. Capturing the true dynamics of these phenomena requires realistic flux tube models and this is the aim of this project. We will study the jet origin, excitation and multiple jet excitation employing a novel 3D MHD code. We will validate results with high-resolution data (e.g. CRISP) to gain insight into the relationship between various solar transients (e.g. jets, MBPs, RBE). By using this combination of numerical simulations and observations of the penetration of jets from the chromosphere, through the transition region into the corona, we will reveal how momentum and energy are transported to the upper atmosphere.
